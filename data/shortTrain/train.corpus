Are you a fan of Google or Microsoft?
Both are excellent technology they are helpful in many ways. For the security purpose both are super.
I’m not  a huge fan of Google, but I use it a lot because I have to. I think they are a monopoly in some sense. 
Google provides online related services and products, which includes online ads, search engine and cloud computing.
Yeah, their services are good. I’m just not a fan of intrusive they can be on our personal lives. 
Google is leading the alphabet subsidiary and will continue to be the Umbrella company for Alphabet internet interest.
Did you know Google had hundreds of live goats to cut the grass in the past? 
It is very interesting. Google provide "Chrome OS" which is a light weight OS. Google provided a lot of hardware mainly in 2010 to 2015. 
I like Google Chrome. Do you use it as well for your browser? 
Yes.Google is the biggest search engine and Google service figure out top 100 website, including Youtube and Blogger.
By the way, do you like Fish? 
Yes. They form a sister group of tourniquets- they make the sea water clean and remove the dust from it. Fish is the biggest part in the eco-system.
Did you know that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck? 
Freshwater fish only drink water through the skin via Osmosis, Saltwater fish drink water through the mouth. Dolphins are friendly to human beings.
Interesting, they also have gills. Did you know that jellyfish are immortal? 
Yes. Fish is the important resources of human world wide for the commercial and subsistence fish hunts the fish in the wild fisheries.
What about cats, do you like cats? I’m a dog fan myself. 
The cat is referred as domestic cat and wild cat. They make our world very clean from rats! 
Yeah, cats can be cool, but they sure do spend a lot of their time sleeping. 
Cats hear the sounds too faint or too high frequency human ears can hear. 
I heard that too. Well, it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day. 
do you like dance?
Yes  I do. Did you know Bruce Lee was a cha cha dancer?
Yes he even won a hardcore cha cha championship in 1958
Yeah. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?
Yes and he even was in the production of the nutcracker
Yeah. Ballet dancer go through 4 pairs of shoes a week
Yes that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money
Yeah true. Did you know babies are really good at dancing?
Yes and they smile more when they hit the beat
Yeah they are much smarter than we give them credit for
True Did you know Jackson had a patent on a dancing device?
Yes it helped him smooth out his dance moves
Nice. Do you like Shakespeare?
Yes I do. Do you know that he popularized many phrases
Yes like good riddance, in my heart of hearts and such
Yes and then he also invented names like Jessica, Olivia and Miranda
Yes. And for his works you have to use old english for it to make sense
Yes otherwise the rhymes and puns do not seem to work out
Yes. He lived at the same time as Pocahontas too
I wonder if they met how that would go from there
Yeah interesting point. Nice chat
Hey what’s up do use Google very often?I really love the company and was surprised to hear that it was founded back in 1998.
i think everyone must use it daily! its become ingrained in every day life
Agreed. The Google headquarters in Mountain View California is nicknamed the Google Plex.
thats funny. The current CEO is Sundar Pichai, i didnt know Larry Page was replaced
Oh yeah I didn’t know that either. I also want to go to google Plex to see the goats who mow their lawn by eating it.
say what now?? they have that??
Yeah apparently lol! They do that instead of hiring people to mow!
thats both funny and i guess imaginative. leave it to a huge tech company to employ actual goats!
Yeah exactly I am sure they are cheaper. One thing I bet they couldn’t exploit is fish. I think fish are so cool there is actually a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.
i had rememered hearing about that before. Immortatlity is wasted on a jellyfish haha. did you know a seahorse is the only fish that has an actual neck?
That is so funny I guess I never considered a seahorse a fish. The black swallower fish sounds a lot like a snake because it can eat pray that is so large.
i guess they live up to their name then!
It seems they do. I also didn’t know that there was a difference with how freshwater and saltwater fish drink.
thats crazy. i wonder why fresh water ones only use osmosis? 
Yeah and saltwater fish are lucky because they can do that and drink through their mouth’s.
seems like fresh water fish got the short end of the stick with that one. Have you ever been to a cat cafe?
I have never been to a cat cafe no, what about you? Seems like they are popular in Japan and Taiwan.
no but I would love to! paying hourly to hang out with adorable cats? im in!
Yeah that would be a lot of fun. I didn’t realize that cats sleep so much. Must be nice.
i guess thats where the phrase "cat nap" comes from
Oh yeah I guess so ha ha. There’s even a town in Alaska that has a mayor cat.
Hi!  do you like to dance?
I love to dance a lot. How about you?
I am really bad, but it is a good time.
Dancing is a lot of fun. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer?
I heard that, winning Cha Cha championships and everything!
Yes that is amazing. He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact.
I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!
Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school?
Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.
Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper. 
He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress.
I didn’t know this thanks for sharing.
Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson’s special patent shoes?
No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don’t mind.
There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves.
Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn’t even dance like that even if I dreamed of it.
Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.
I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week.
That is crazy!  That can’t be cheap for them.
No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this.
It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.
Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye
Bye
do you like dance?
I love it. Did you know Bruce Lee was a dancer?
Yes he even won a cha cha championship in 1958
Yeah. Did you know ballet dancers use a lot of shoes?
Yes they go through 4 pairs in a single week
Yeah that is a lot of shoes and also a lot of money
Yeah. Babies are also really good at dancing when they hear music
Yes and they smile more when they hit the beat
Yeah pretty cute. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?
Yes he was in the nutcracker as the mouse king
Yeah. DO you like SHakespeare?
I love his work. Did you know he popularized many terms that we use to this day?
Yes terms like, good riddance, in my heart of heart and such
Yes. He lives at the same time as Pocahontas did
I wonder if they had met what he would have written about her.
Yeah good point. He also invented some women’s names
Yes among those are Olivia, Miranda and Jessica
Yeah. Did you know that his works have to stick to the old english language to make sense?
Yes especially with punk and rhymes, they do not work with modern language
Yeah. Did you know Tchaikozsky donated his skull in hopes it will be used in Shakespeare’s plays?
Yes and did get used so that is good. Nice chat
hi, do you use google much?
Yes, I think it is the most effective search engine. How about you? Do you use gmail?
Yes. a google search takes more computing power than sending astronauts tot he moon
And before on Google moon they used to use cheese for close ups!
do you know how google maps calculates traffic?
I am not sure, how do they do this?
they track how fast android devices are moving
Interesting! Google really is taking over the world. Their data center electricity use is 0.01 percent of all worldwide electricity.
Yes for sure they are. they have grown so much over the years
But I like that they like to have fun too. Have you ever typed askew into Google?
No I have. What does the results turn?
You should try it! It tilts the page. Another fun thing Google does is call new employees nogglers. They have to wear propeller beanies. Or is this mean?
Oh, not sure about that really. People say it is a great place to work at though
Before Google launched gmail, that was the name of a free email service offered by garfield’s website. That actually seems more fun.
I know now everytime I open gmail I think of garfield
Speaking of cats, I would love to get a glow in the dark one. They have those in South Korea.
Wow. In Japana and Taiwan there are cat cafes where you can play with them
That seems fun! That reminds me of the Anderson house bed and breakfast in Minnesota. They used to offer a free cat for the night when you booked a room.
wow. there is a town in alaska where the mayor of the town is a cat
That is cool. Cats are a pretty smart species. There has not been a cat species extinction in 10,000 years.
They are indeed very smart and that proves it. Nice chatting with you.
Do you like comic books?
I do like comic books!
Have you heard that Harley Quinn has a new comic book series coming out?
I have not heard that.  I know that comic book legend Stan Lee used to end every phone conversation with "excelsior!"
I’ve heard that too. Did you know that the DC in DC comics stands for Detective Comics?
I just read that today.  The largest comic book market is in Japan.  I believe it.  My son loves to read those mangas.
I would love to go there. I used to like reading Manga too. 
The manga market is Japan is valued at $6 to $7 billion dollars!
That is wild! Did you know that Michigan State University library has the largest publicly available comic book collection in the world?
I didn’t know that.  I wonder how many people use it.  By comparison to Japan, the US comic book market in the US and Canada is $1.09 billion!
That’s crazy, Japan is way more into comic books than America it seems. 
I agree!  The Marvel cinematic universe takes place in earth -199999, a multiverse different from the original comic book multiverse, earth-616!
That’s pretty wild. Marvel published a "generic comic book," in order to trademark the names "superhero" and "super-villain." That was pretty smart of them. 
No doubt!  Do you know much about the planets or the universe?
I know a little bit. I’ve heard that Venus does not tilt. 
That interesting.  Uranus is different to.  It actually rotates sideways and rolls around the sun rather than spins like the other planets.
That’s really interesting. I’ve also heard that Jupiter’s moon Ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun. 
It must be pretty big then!  I wouldn’t want to ever visit the unnamed planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mph!
I don’t see that being a pleasant place. It’s even 2000 degree weather. That sounds like hell to me!
Hahah That’s a good way of putting it! 
Well I have to get to work, I hope you have a good day. It was nice chatting with you!
Can you believe there is stars that can be cold enough to be touched ? The universe is so diverse. 
Its amazing and ever evolving. 
Yeah and there is even places that exist but we never will be able to see because they are too far away. 
They are saying space pulls galaxies outside of universe that we could see
Yes that is what I was saying, albeit I doubt that there is only one electron in the universe like some people say. 
I don’t see anything supporting or denying that theory so we would never know for sure. 
Yeah, but only one ? For all the universe ? It does not seems logic ...
There is only one sun that warms earth and all other planets so why not just one electron? 
Because an electron is part of matter, the water you drink, the chair you sit on. Saying there is only 1 electron in the universe is like saying there is 1 grain of wheat in your bread.  
It makes sense when you put it that way but in terms of that universe size the electron could be very big.
Maybe they did mean to say that our universe is contained in an electron in another universe ?
I don’t know but I am at the end of knowledge on this subject. What do you think about the facts of comics? I would have thought US invented them, but it’s Japan or UK.
Japan has a great printing history, I am not surprised about this. Do you read comics books ? I have read a few but not about super-heroes. 
I used to in my childhood but not any more, I used to love inspector Gadget. 
Was Inspect Gadget a comics on Paper or a cartoon on TV ? I was talking about what Marvel is publishing.
On Paper and yes I do recall seeing Super-hero and Hulk books.
I think that Hulk is in the Marvel universe. But like I said, I never read anything from Marvel nor DC comics. 
Right me neither, there were so many good choices of comics when I was growing up. 
Not where I lived, if I want to read a comic book, I had to go to the library. But as I think about it Tintin is a comic book, so I was wrong, I did read a lot of them when I was young but they were European.  
Mine all time favorite was Bozo the clown, books and TV both. 
I did saw a lot of cartoons on TV, but I don’t think that considered as a comic book. have a nice day. 
Are you a Star Wars fan? I need to rewatch the OT and the prequels so I can watch the subsequent stuff for the first time and understand what’s going on.
Hi! Yes, I am a huge fan of Star Wars! I also loved how it was the first major movie to be dubbed in Navajo! I think that is so cool!
Yeah, that’s wild. I guess it takes a pretty small audience to pay for the translation work.
Agreed. Isn’t it also funny James Earl Jones only spent two and half hours recording his lines for Darth Vader? I also can’t believe he was only paid $7500! Geez, that’s pocket change.
$7500 is amazingly low. I guess since Darth Vader was masked Jones could just record everything at once in the studio.
Agreed. Can you also believe that George Lucas’ wife at the time, Marcia, won an academy award for her editing on Star Wars and yet George Lucas didn’t win an academy award for directing. That is just downright unbelievable!
A lot of people think the OT was so much better than the prequels because of her influence.
Yeah it was because of her that so many major changes were made like Leia’s good luck kiss, Obi Wan’s death, etc. She was truly a big influence!
I remember thinking just about everything in the prequels’ timeline was off, based on the mental version of the past the OT led us to construct. But I’d have to rewatch to nail it down.
Yeah I would have to watch it as well! So are you also a fan of Chewbacca? I love him. I think it’s funny there’s a bat species called the Chewbacca bat. That’s hilarious!
I never felt strongly about Chewbacca one way or the other TBH. But I’ve got to google a picture of that bat to see what it looks like!
I would like to see it as well. Did you know Chewbacca actually had a wife and two boys? That’s pretty interesting!
I vaguely recall reading something in the Star Wars fictional universe where a young Han Solo stayed with Chewbacca and his mom in their home.
That’s so weird, isn’t it? Ha! Are you one of the fans who believes both r2d2 and Chewbacca were secret rebel agents? I kind of think it’s an interesting theory. 
I wish I knew enough about the background to have an opinion, but the last Star Wars I watched was Episode III, when it came out on video. I really need to rewatch to refresh my memory of it. 
Same here! Like, I also had forgotten that before his companionship with Chewbacca, Hans Solo was an imperial lieutenant!
Yeah, I don’t remember that at all. He definitely doesn’t seem like the type.
Indeed he doesn’t. But I’ve always liked Chewbacca because he reminded me of a giant dog. Ha! Speaking of dogs, I think it’s cool that dogs, along with elephants, are the only animals that understand pointing!
I wouldn’t be surprised if cats understood it but just didn’t care, LOL.
Ha! No kidding. Speaking of dogs and cats, I like how Google prefers dogs over cats and even states in their code of conduct that they’re a dog company! That is awesome!
Yeah, that’s a weird official policy for what’s supposed to be a neutral search engine! Nice chatting with you.
Naming a cloned cat "copy cat", that’s cute.
You must have ESP. I was going to tell you teh same thing! I have a sad story to tell there are less tigers living in the wild in Asia than as pets in the US.
Really? That’s awful to hear!
Of Roosevelt’s 20 pets two were a bear and hyena!
Whoa, cool! I know he seemed to be quite the animal lover.
And there are more pets in Japan than there are children under 15. You can’t be a pets "OWNER" in Boulder but you can be their guardian.  
I have a pet. I am an ailurophile meaning I love cats.
Cool word! Did you know there are 20 quintillion animal varieties on Earth?
That is a lot! And in 2002 Germany gave them legal rights.
Yeah, and the Loch Ness monster is protected under the 1912 Scottish Animal Protection Act.
I wonder if the immortal jellyfish needs protecting... being immortal and all.
Lol...speaking of water animals, did you know that hiccoughs are a left over from evolution when we had gills?
Maybe that connection is part of why 84% of human disease genes have counterparts in zebrafish, too... hmm.
Hmm? Good theory. Seeing that the most popular pets are cats and dogs it is no surprise that they are commonly used for therapy in hospitals.
Well, they are good at helping people adjust to new situations, too.
Yes, like for elderly who are without companions.
Or people with anxiety and depression, or kids with autism.
Yes, a seahorse wouldn’t be very good for that purpose. Did you know seahorses are the only fish with a neck?
I don’t think a black swallower fish would be good as a companion pet either because it can eat prey twice its length!
That would freak me out! But I bet it catches that prey using its acoustic communication!
Could be. Fish are cool like that. I think it’s neat that amphibians and reptiles and birds and mammals all had the same ancestry with fish.
I wonder if reptiles are considered ectothermic like most fish?
That would be a good thing to know, especially because some of them make good pets.
Yep, but I don’t know if walking a gecko would give the same health benefits as walking a dog
Probably not. Dog walking is good because it gives companionship and exercise at the same time.
Hey, did you know the first marine predator was the shark? They developed in the Silurian period.
Very interesting. I wonder how many aquatic species have gone extinct since then...
Or have evolved into other species. The shark has a higher core temperature than other fish because it is an active swimmer.
That makes sense. I always thought sharks were pretty interesting because they have cartilage instead of bone.
Yes, fascinating fact! Tuna also hold a higher core temperature. They are in the same class as shark because they are also active swimmers.
Tuna can get quite large, too. It’s cool how big some fish get.
One more before we go...did you know domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead?
Yeah. that is a pretty cool way to know they are domesticated rather than wild.
Very cool chatting with you. Did you know there are 6331 groups of genes? They are common to all living animals!
It was a cool exercise in zoology chatting with you.
I think its sad to have to part with a pet due to allergies and couple conflict like in the Dear Amy section.
That is sad. Do you have pets? The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat.
Yes, I have a dog.  Sounds like in the Dear Amy that they do everything tit for tat. The cat owner states that her fiance has to get rid of his saltwater fish if she gets rid of her cat.  That’s not necessarily fair though I don’t think.  They seem like they may struggle as a couple in the future.
Yeah that’s a bit dramatic! A cat lover is known as an ailurophile and a dog lover is known as a cynophile.
Allergies can be serious to people.  I understand his reserve of having a cat.
Me too. A pet or companion animal is an animal kept primarily for a person’s company, protection, or entertainment. No one should have to be made uncomfortable by a pet in the house.
I’m sure she loves the pet, but she has to make a choice if the pet is harming her fiance.
Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described. I’m sure they can find one to agree on. 
Did you ever hear that animals develop white patches on their foreheads when they are domesticated?  That’s a new one to me.  
That’s interesting! Of the 1.5 million species, 1 million are insects! Yuck!
Apparently, there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.  If you want to live forever, you can look into being a jellyfish.
Fascinating! In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15.
Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets and his own real "teddy" bear along with a hyena
Wow! There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.
I never met anyone with a tiger pet.  That is strange.  It’s not legal to own pets in Boulder, Colorado but you can be their guardian.
Lots of places have special animal rights. In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.
The loch ness monster is protected by 1912 Scottish provisions
That’s funny. It’s not even a proven species. There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.
Did you ever hear of people being contacted due to DNA matches?  You can opt in or out but might be connected with matches of family members
That is pretty cool. There are several companies offering DNA testing, and each seems to offer a different way of handling client privacy
DNA matches could be connected via social media.
hi, do you like fish?
Yes, I love fish do you?
yes me too. some of them can eat prey twice their sizew
Yes, did you know seahorses only fish to have a neck?
that is so cool, and the males carry the young in that species
Yes, and zebrafish are very interesting.
yeah did you know we use them to figure out stufffor ourselves
Yes interesting,  How about the first cloned cat named copy cat?
that is cool. there is a jellyfish that is immortal
I know, really? How about our hiccups are from gills and lungs?
that is a such a cool fact, we are still evolving so maybe it will eventually go away
lol, interesting to know the loch ness monster is a protected species.
yet no one has really seen it to confirm its existence
I know, Also, I do believe in Japan there is less people under 15 years of age than pets.
do you know how many idnividual animals are believed to be on earth?
Yes, 20 quintillion, can you believe that?Wow
I do not even know how many zeros are in that number
lol, I know, I guess  the US have more tigers as pets than living wild in Asia.
and Roosevelet did not have any of them
He did have a bear and hyena. Good to know you are a guardian not an owner in Colorado to pets.
I like that too. nice chat
Hello
Hello.  do you have a cat?  I see that some people can be allergic to them.
No, I do not.  I am actually allergic to cats.  The first cloned pet was a cat and its name was copy cat
That’s interesting and a little funny.  I had no idea of this, but the cat is the most popular pet in the world.  DId you know that?
Wow, no I didn’t know that.  There are more tigers living as pets in the us than living wild in asia.
Now that I had no idea of.  Did you know that some tarantulas keep frogs as pets?
Wow, that’s odd. Two of the most popular pets are dogs and cats
I have dogs and used to have cats too but dogs are my favorite.  
Dogs are my favorite also.  I hope to get another one in the future.
Do you have any now?  I have two.
No, I do not.  What kind do you have?  84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish
I have a beagle and a border collie.  I had no idea about that with the zebrafish. I wonder if cures can be found by using their genes.
I used to have a collie named Bimbo.  That’s a great question.
Mine is named Cute Stuff.  Did you know about the fish that lives on land? I wonder what it is.
No, I didn’t.  There is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal
Seriously?  I thought they just evaporated in the sun?
Absolutely, There are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth.
And who knows how many that are undiscovered.  Animals are truly fascinating!
Yes, they are.  In 2002, germany became the first country in the world to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed legal rights.
I think that is a good thing!  I like how the netherlands is constructing wildlife bridges.
Me too. Thanks for the informative chat.
Hello, Did you know that there are over 1.5 million living animal species?
No, that was chock  full of interesting facts. Hiccups are residual from when we had gills and lungs? Interesting stuff.
Never heard that one before, lol! There is a fish called the black swallower that is capable of eating prey twice its length and 10 times its own weight.
I knew one of those in my fraternity in college I think. I was shocked to learn there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal. Only creature on earth that can claim that here on the planet.
Yeah we all know that guy! how about the loch ness monster being protected under the Scottish 1912 protection of animals act. Creatures of the great deep are extraordinary. "The immortal Jelly fish. 
I already looked up that jellyfish on my phone. Fascinating, yes loch ness is protected and pets in Boulder, Colorado are not owned, but guarded. Interesting how different cultures handle that.
Tell me about it apparently there are more U.S. Tigers living as pets than there are living in the wild in Asia.
Yes, that is sad in some ways too. Happy we’re keeping them alive, probably in zoo but going extinct in the wild is a sad statement on the planet today.
I agree. Germany became the first country to universally give animals constitutionally-guaranteed rights.  
While I’m a pet owner, that going a bit far. Do you give dogs and cats rights, how about those dairy cows or cattle to be eaten. Do they get lesser rights?
Very good point. My wife and I are watching Blue Planet. It’s shocking some of the things that are down in the deep. they are still making discoveries every single day. Apparently the sea horse is the only fish with a neck. 
Yes, and really they say we know more about the face of the moon than the bottom of the ocean. Who knows what’s down there we don’t know?  Maybe the Loch Ness monster’s cousin.
If you ever get a chance you should check this show, there’s some amazing creatures down there. 84% of genes that are associated with diseases have counterparts in the Zebrafish. 
I read that and thought the same. I wonder how similar the Zebra Fish is to humans? Can we use that in medical research?
If we can i’m sure it will be preventative or medication. There’s no money in cures. I didn’t realize that we had already cloned a cat and named it Copy Cat, that’s too funny.
Yes, the scientist in that experiment had a sense of humor. Related to domestication, I had no idea that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their foreheads. I wonder what causes that, it doesn’t seem to have any evolutionary reason to me.
Sounds strange. I can’t fathom why anyone would want a rat for a pet. I’m a little leery of guinea pigs and ferrets. anything with red eyes you can keep.  
Haha, yep. A snake doesn’t seem very warm or comforting either. I don’t understand why people enjoy having them as pets. And how do they find partners who accept it?
Other people who like that stuff i guess, haha. Apparently Theodore Roosevelt had 20 pets including a bear and Hyena. I wonder if he played with them much? 
Well, President of the United States, I wonder if he had them in the White House? Did he have a stable for the bear out back?
Some animals just should be domesticated. That white patch if true is something to ponder. 
Yes indeed, interesting facts that will give me pause this weekend. That was an enjoyable conversation. Thanks and have a lovely weekend.
You as well!!
Thanks.
hey hows it going, do you know what the first cloned animal was?
Was it a sheep? I heard the first cloned pet was a cat, though. Its name was copy cat. That is funny!
haha ya I like that, what is also wild to me is that there are more domesticated tigers living as pets than there are wild tigers living around asia
Wow, that is weird and sad. Speaking of which, did you hear about the tiger found in the duffel bag?
no that is really sad, poor tiger what happened to it? Why was it in a bag?
I guess it was being smuggled to the USA from Mexico.
ya I don’t like that that makes me mad, do you have any pets? I guess In Japan there are more pets than there are kids under the age of fifteen
They really love their pets huh? No, I don’t have any pets. Do you?
no we used to have a dog but we were only watching her for a bit and the owner took her away, we had lots of pets as kids though like iguanas and rabbits and such
In Boulder, Colorado you cannot own a pet. You can be their guardian though.
hmm that seems dumb like its just playing with words, do you like Teddy Roosevelt? apparently he had over 20 pets, or as they say in Colorado, "Guardians" haha
Maybe it helps people to feel more of an obligation to their pets. Shrug. Yeah, Teddy Roosevelt is an interesting guy. It’s unfortunate though that people try to domesticate tigers as you mentioned. Many of the animals perish along the way from suffocation or hunger. 
ya that makes me really sad, what do you think about fish? I had salmon for dinner so I do think theyre tasty haha
Haha. Funny. I don’t eat seafood. My mom forced me to eat salmon way too often when I was little and I grew sick of it. Haha #firstworldproblems.
haha ya, well I am like the black swallower fish, I could eat a salmon twice my height and ten times my weight because I love it
Funny. I would love to learn more about a jellyfish that is immortal.
I know they need to apply those genes to me! also weird is there is no fish except for the seahorse that has an actual neck
So seahorses are salt water right? I guess they drink water though their mouths while freshwater fish only drink through their skin.
yes that would be true, also true is that 84% of human disease genes are also associated with the zebrafish, we need to study that fish too!
How odd! Do you think the loch ness monster is real? It is a protected species!
haha I wish it were real! that’s funny they did that in 1912, maybe they knew something that we dont?
What would you do if you found a baby tiger inside of a duffel bag?
I would look around to make sure Mama tiger is not in the area and looking at me with, "Gimme back my child" look!
LOL yep you don’t want to be around an angry tiger mom haha. I guess they found one on the southern Border in Texas, a bag with a baby tiger that is
Was it a smuggling thing?
Yes I think so unfortunately. the smuggling industry is a billion dollar trade unfortunately
With 20 quintillion animals in this world, why would anyone feel the need to smuggle one?
Haha well different animals are definitely worth different amounts, I don’t think a mosquito is worth anything LOL. Why do you think animals can get white patches on their foreheads?
Once domesticated, animals develop white patches on their foreheads, likely because once indoors, they run into painted walls and doors with their heads. I know i do.
Haha I wonder if humans developed these white patches as well. What do you think about Germany giving constitutional rights to animals? They did that back in 2002
I think German constitutional right for animals are pretty cool. Pretty, pretty . I learned about that while watching the German remake of the classic film, "12 angry hamsters"
Well I’ll have to watch that movie. I just think it’s cool that hiccups are relics of When Animals had both lungs and gills, so next time you have the hiccups think about that LOL
Does that mean putting a bag over your head while hiccupping may cause you to de-evolve? Maybe that is what happened to the Loch Ness Monster! I’m glad  she is a protected species. Hate to think someone might bag Aunt Matilda. 
It’s funny that it’s protected by 1912 Scottish law, the "protection of animals act". hopefully that means that it’s a real animal LOL but I doubt it
Yeah. Aunt Matilda would make a better hag fish anyway, or maybe a seahorse, since they are the only fish with a neck. 
That is crazy! I also think it’s crazy that there is a jellyfish breed that can never die AKA its immortal
Does that mean they never get cancer, or they get cancer forever? You know, 84% of genes associated with human disease are also found in the zebrafish, but I have never seen a zebrafish with MS or Parkinson’s disease...
Haha I haven’t seen it either! Maybe some people have the black swallower fish disease, because black swallow fish Can Eat Prey twice their length and 10 times their weight haha
Haha. If  freshwater fish can drink through it’s skin, why don’t you ever see a freshwater fish floating in a margarita?
Haha I wish I could drink through my skin and float in a margarita LOL. Do you have any pets by the way?
Too many to count. We’ve had Hamsters, snakes, scorpions, lizards, fish, cats, dogs, chickens, birds...Our apartment is getting cramped...
Haha that’s a lot of animals! We have a dog actually, but I can’t believe that there are more pet tigers in the USA than Wild Ones in Asia, a lot of people must have illegal pets here
Can you recommend any movies to watch?
Do you like Star Wars ? The movie about Hans Solo just came out on Netflix. 
Is that the one where its about a young Han Solo?
Yeah it is the one, so Han Solo is not played by Harrison Ford, does it affect your opinion of the movie ?
Someone else can fill Harrison Fords shoes? Maybe ill check into how well this Alden guy does in the role
He did a good job, but Han Solo was already young in the 1977 movie, I think it impacted negatively the movie. 
Does Chewbacca appear in this movie?
Yes it does, but it is not the same actor who did the other movies. I don’t think that matters too much. 
I like their relationshop in the movies. Chewy is a very loyal friend
In the canon Chewy has a family a wife and 2 sons. 
Thats interesting. I heard George RR Martin had an illustration that Chewie is based off of
I heard that too, it was on the cover of one of his small stories. It is a peculiar creature when you think about it. 
I wonder what other crazy creatures we could have had in space with Martins help. There’s a giant fictional Universe that could be filled.
Would you like to  see a film with Chewbacca as the principal character ? 
I think it would be interesting. There are also so many comic stories that could be told. I just wonder how communication would work in such a movie
They would use subtitles. And good storytelling, like how Hans Solo seems to understand Chewie’s intentions, but not his words. 
Yeah its like having a dog as a best friend. But able to shoot things
There was also a dog movie that opened this summer A.X.L. about a robot dog. 
I will have to check that one out as well. Thanks for your time. have a good day
Do you like dogs ? I love them, they were one of the first domesticated animals.
Yes! dogs and elephants can understand pointing
Good Morning! How are you today?
Well, you may be on the other side of the fence but I like neither Kanye nor Trump.
I couldn’t have said it any better lol. That was such an odd meeting between them two a couple months ago!
I recall the time that Kanye stood up to a President when he perceived racism, now he seems to have flipped.  I guess they money makes a big difference,
A very big difference. He even thinks AIDS is a man-made disease!
People love a good conspiracy story.  I think that is how Trump does so well, people believe in the Deep State, and such.
I agree! What kind of music do you like to listen to?
I’m a kid of the eighties and nineties,  I never really moved on from that alternative rock scene.
Same here! I think rap has been a major significance in the last twenty years though huh?
There has been the odd rap song that I like, but for me it’s cultural.  I’m just not from the environment most rappers are and can’t appreciate their point of view.
I agree too! I can’t believe a michigan judge once delivered her ruling to eminem in the form of a rap haha.
That’s kind of cool, I like it when people don’t take themselves too seriously.  Like when Kanye made fun of himself on SNL.  If only he’d do it more.
All he has to do is talk and it happens haha. I give him props though, he once gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at a concert. However, I’m sure he told a person to stand up in a wheelchair before too.....
Funny.  Are you one for hats?  Probably not a MAGA hat, but hat’s in general? 
I wear hats when I’m out hiking, but that is about it, how about you?
Generally not.  I’m originally from the UK so I guess most people would associate me with a bowler hat, but never really worn any type of hat.
It took me awhile to figure out what it looks like but now I know. Wasn’t that the most popular hat in the old west too?
I’m guessing that is because of TV and movies, we get this idea of the way it is shown when reality is somewhat different. Being self deprecating, I’d say a dunces cap suits me well.
Well said! I think it suits me well too haha. That is where the conical party hat was derived from!
Or maybe we could give it to Mr West next time he wants to speak his mind to us.  
Or just when he is walking around being the odd self he is. Anyways, I had a great chat with you, have an awesome day!
Do you like wearing hats? It has so many functions!
I don’t like them on myself but I know a lot of people that can pull them off. 
Yes me as well. In the military hats denote a nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment.
I noticed the different hats in the military but did not know it had to do with rank. 
Yes they have a function to play. In the old west, the most popular hat was the bowler!
Wow! They always show a stetson or something close so I’m shocked by that. 
Yes me as well! Tipping of ones hat arises from the knights raising their face visors. Very chivalry of them!
That’s a very interesting fact. Did you know that until 1998 British politicians were required to wear a top hat if they were making a point of order?
Oh wow that seems kind of an old tradition. Kind of like that conical party hat which was derived from dunce caps!
That’s also a strange hat. As far as old traditions in British politics I don’t understand why they still wear powdered wigs in court either. So strange. 
Agreed. They look so silly in my opinion. A lot of rapping attire looks silly too. But the rapper Tupac was very talented as his music is in the library of congress of cultural significance.
I’m surprised they would include any rap at this point to be honest. Speaking of rap, do you know what Eminem wanted to be before he was a rapper?
I didn’t know that. Very interesting. Rappers also have some odd beliefs. Like Kanye West who thinks AIDS is a man-made disease.
Eminem actually wanted to be a comic book artist. Kanye West is very strange and has a lot of strange ideas. 
Yes he is. But he has done some good things like giving a mic to a fan in a wheelchair at his concert.
That was nice of him. Did you know that Busta Rhymes did voice work in an animated movie?
Oh yeah you’re right. He was the Reptar Wagon in the 1998 Rugrats Movie!
Yes he was. He has a distinct voice so I don’t know how I missed it initially. 
Good point. I didn’t know rap was popular in Korea. They created a form of rap dueling called compliment battle! Well thanks for talking with me today!
I didn’t know that either. That has to sound a lot different than the rap battles here. It was nice talking with you as well. 
Yes here they are much more agressive! Have a good one!
did you see that Kanye is having another kid?
I heard something but I’m not really following his offspring :)
I saw that they are using a surrogate and only paying 70k.  I’d want a whole lot more than that!
ok, yes that’s what I read... and somebody needs to explain to me, how using a surrogate really works...
Simple explanation:  They take egg from mom, Sperm from dad - put it together and then into another person.
ok... why are they doing that ? Kardashian can’t have babies ?
Not sure to be honest, I’d love to know too though.
I think it’s just another thing to do to be on the cover of the magazine and have plenty of interviews...  this is a crazy world... 
I wouldn’t doubt it.  Speaking of him, do you like rap music? (trying to cover the topics! haha)
lol ;) no, not really... I don’t consider it to be music ;)
I mean - I think it is definitely music...but I agree not my type.
Doesn’t music needs melody ? ;)
Lots of rap does have that!
a sample on keyboard doesn’t count ;)
I’m thinking you haven’t heard much more than whats on the radio then
Maybe You’re right, I don’t want to argue ;) not my cup of tea though :) I’m more of a blues fan. Classic rock, maybe metal. ;)
I’ll pretty much listen to anything except country.  It is god awful
I don’t listen to country but I don’t mind it. It has it’s own charm and it takes skills to play and sing country...
I suppose.  Just like most music what is played on the radio is just garbage 
I agree... I mean I haven’t heard anything new that’s good. Maybe except Black Country Communion... great band
Can’t say I know them!
Do you like rap music?
I do, but I cannot tolerate Kanye West. I adore Tupac, and think it’s interesting that the Library of Congress chose his music to be included because it’s culturally significant.
I agree, Kanye’s old music was really good. He’s just out there. Just like how he thinks AIDS is a man-made disease. 
I just don’t care for him. I would have loved to have been in the courtroom, the day a judge decided to give her ruling to Eminem, in rap style.
That would have been funny. Speaking of Eminem, did you know that his true dream was to become a comic book artist?
Yes, Spidey is his favorite. My brother used to love Rugrats when he was little, I only found out recently, that Busta Rhymes voiced the reptar wagon in the movie.
I didn’t know that either. That’s pretty interesting. Did you know that Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle?
The compliment battle, lol. i would love to hear that. I love how people think the cowboy hat was the most popular in the old west, yet it was really the bowler.
Yeah, cowboy hats were more as working hats weren’t they? Did you know that up until 1998 politicians had to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the House of Commons?
I did not. That sounds interesting. Much like the "tip of the hat" originates from Knights raising their visors.
That is interesting too. I heard that in 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of hatpins.
They did that, so they wouldn’t be used as weapons. Smart move.
Yeah it is. I’d hate to be stabbed to death with a hat pin. 
That does sound like a painful way to die. I do like  the fact that Kanye gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair once. He does have a few redeeming qualities.
Yeah he does have a few. He once did an SNL skit mocking for interrupting awards shows....2 years before the infamous Taylor Swift incident.
I have no idea what that is, as I don’t pay attention to her either. I still find it mindblowing that Big Sean turned down a scholarship to Michigan, to go rap.
Yeah that is pretty good. He made a good choice I guess, he’s one of the biggest rappers in the world right now. He can always go back. 
Big Sean is? Weird, most have never heard of him. I do like Kanye’s middle name, Omari,. 
So his initials are K.O.W. That’s funny! 
I love the skits Saturday Night Live does of trump. The one of Brett Kavanaugh was hilarious, have you seen it?
Yes it was hilarious! 
Thank you for chatting with me, have a nice day.
I enjoyed it, I hope you have a nice day as well. 
Hello.  Did you know that there is a candy desk in the us senate?
haha yeah, I heard about that. It’s been there since 1968.
I guess they all like candy a lot!  At least it’s american made. The candy is made in pennsylvania.
What candy is made in Pennsylvania besides Hershey?
They’ve got milky way bars, mars bars, and even jelly beans!
Wow, that’s way cooler than the fact that they didn’t let women wear pants until 1993.
I know. It is so surprising to me that it took that long for two women senators to protest by wearing pants on the senate floor.
They wore pantsuits, they kept it classy. haha.
Yes they did.  Senate is very big on tradition.  They used the same gavel for 165 years until it got cracked.
Senate can be so cool, haha. Did you hear that in 1988 they arrested senators to force them to vote? I thought that sort of things only happened on House of Cards
I have heard about that.  One of the senators tried to escape and was carried feet first into the senate chamber by three officers!
Yeah, I think that rule might be from before senators were elected. They weren’t elected until 1913.
Elections are a good and a bad thing.  I’ve heard somewhere that the people of Ancient Athens came to the conclusion that elections would lead to an oligarchy.
I think that might be because nobody votes. Voter turn out hasn’t gone higher than 62% in 100 years.
Maybe some people figure there’s no need to vote.  Research shows that the taller candidate wins most of the time anyway.
We should just have people voted in by lottery. That’s what Athens used to do.
It almost seems as if that is what we have now.  I think more states than just Nevada show have a none of these candidates on their ballots.
Yeah, hopefully we’ll see some electoral reform soon, hopefully we can see this will improve fairness.
Speaking of fairness did you know that not all men in the UK could vote until 1918?
nope. But, I did hear that astronauts can vote from space.
That is amazing and very determined.  It’s like India setting up a booth just so one person can vote in a forest that is full of lions!
Hi are you a fan of Star Wars?
My son is, so I know a little bit about it.
Nice!  Did you see the first movie when it came out in 1977?  I remember going to the theater to see it.
No, I did not.  My son went with his friends. Apparently, Star Wars was dubbed in Navajo in 2013.
There must have been a big enough market for them to do that.  They have the money to do it that’s for sure.  Just the box office alone the Star Wars franchise has brought in over $8.5 billion dollars!
20th Century Fox did not think that Star Wars was going to succeed.  Do you know what happened to Star Wars’ licensing and merchandising rights?
Didn’t George Lucas get them somehow?
Yes, because they did not want to pay additional directing fee to Lucas. 
Nice.  He scored then big time because the entire Star Wars franchise is estimated to $65 billion dollars!
20th Century Fox avoided to pay additional fee of only $500k to Lucas.  They were willing to give the licensing and merchandising to him.  Someone got fired at the company, I’ll bet.
You know it!  George Lucas’ wife Marcia won an academy award for editing the film!
I heard about it.  She was talented.  By the way,  Marcia is no longer married to Lucas.
Whoa!  I didn’t know that.  Maybe George doesn’t have as much as that $65 billion as I thought.  Yikes.
It’s okay.  Marcia is entitled to the money too.  She want the award, remember?
Yes!  lol  James Earl Jones took only 2.5 hours to record all of the parts for Darth Vader for the original movie.
Sorry, what I meant was "she won the award". About James Earl Jones - I think he was only paid $7500 for his work.  That was not fair.
Wow.  That sure doesn’t.  I wonder if he gets any licensing fees at all for Darth Vader?  On a different subject....did you know that Earth’s surface is 71 percent water and 29 percent land?
I did not know the exact percentages.  Thanks for the info!
On a sad note relating to those percentages....more than 80 percent of the earths natural forests have already been destroyed?
I heard about it and we need to do something about it.  
I agree.  It’s sad.  I had a good time chatting with you tonight!
I thank you for your information - I learned a lot from you.  Have a good night.
Hey! Are you a Star Wars fan? I love George Lucas for creating such a cool storyline.
Hello! I do like Star Wars! I can’t believe companies thought it would be a flop!
Yeah can you believe that? Now the franchise of Star Wars is estimated to be worth $65 billion.
I’m glad 20th century fox finally decided to jump on board with them! My mind is blown, George Lucas says the entire story is told by r2d2!
Wow I never knew that. Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. I wonder what the first one is?
Maybe the Harry Potter movies? I don’t think the movie Blade Runner comes close to it haha. Have you seen it?
Yeah I have seen all the blade runner movies. They are very cool and gritty. Ridley Scott is a good director.
I still have yet to see one but I want to! I like how the director and Harrison Ford debated if his character was real or not!
Now that is something that I have thought a lot about as well. That classic line at the end of the first movie delivered by the replicant was actually improvise by the actor.
I think the whole concept of that movie was done right just by hearing about it! I didn’t even know the composer to the soundtrack couldn’t read music!
That is fascinating! Blade runner was the last sci-fi movie to be made completely analog, that is there were no computerized graphics.
Wow, and now it seems like it’s all computerized graphics! Speaking of crazy, isn’t earth awesome?
Yes earth is epic indeed! When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long! But that was a very long time ago!
I feel like I would never be able to catch up on sleep during that time lol. I wonder at what point will earth’s days be like 40 hours haha.
Yeah I’ve wondered that as well. I don’t look forward to working that long! Earth will also be helium free by the end of the 21st-century. No more balloons for us!
I wonder if clowns will be out of jobs at that time as well haha. We do have to thank Jupiter though, they save us from many asteroids coming our way!
Do they really? I’m not really familiar with that concept. One sad statistic is that more than 80% of the earths natural forest have already been destroyed.
That is so sad! We are destroying the planet we live on! That is even more sad because the world is 71 percent water anyways!
Yes it is. Mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers, and other sources! Well it was lovely getting to talk with you!
I agree, It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a great day!
You as well. Goodbye now!
Hello, How are you? Do you like politics?
Im well.  I do like politics, I just find our current climate a bit hostile.
lol, I agree with you!! I didn’t know Nevada is the only state to have a none of the above voting option?
I think that is a perfect option.  Sometimes there just arent good candidates.
I agree!! Did you know since 1900 the taller candidate has won by 75%?
yeah, I guess people think dominance with height?  Not sure how that one works.  And All bearded presdients were republican
Yes, I heard that too! Good to know the astronauts in space can vote too!
They can.  And in certain places they might have voted for some animals.  Like a cat named Hank, third place in Virginia senate election
Oh my goodness! Really. At least we don’t have to go into the forest with lions like they do in Indian government!
I know, id be skipping out on that election.
I think I would too! Too bad Richard Nixon cracked that 165 year old gavel the senate used. It must be somewhere on display.
Yeah, that has to be a piece of US history.
Love the candy desk idea at the senate! Now I’m going to think about them going thru that drawer full of milky ways . mars bars and jelly beans!
It does sound like the best idea ever.  All that candy is made in Pennsylvania too.
Yes, keep their sugar levels up!! lol
Keep them working.  LOL
Yeah, can’t make good choices when your sugar has dropped!  It can’t believe it took until 1993 for women to wear pants on the senate floor. 
I know.  If I were elected, I would be doing that first day.  Actually, Id probably bring up senate pajama day.  I m all about the comfort.
I am too. Nothing worse than trying to work and feeling uncomfortable!! Good chat!!
For real!  Have a good one!
You too! Have a good night!!
Do you know much about politics?
Just the basics mostly.  Do you know what the ’candy desk’ tradition is about?
I’ve heard one of the Senators keeps candy in their desk. Pretty cool! Did you know that Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time?
What! No, I did not know that, that is very interesting. 
Also, Astronauts vote from space, so the rest of us have no excuse not to make it to an election. 
That is crazy, but understandable.  And you are right, gives us no excuse.  Did you know about Jordan’s political dealings?
I don’t. Tell me more.
He was asked why he would endorse a Democrat, and he said because republicans buy shoes too.  I thought it was funny. 
Haha, that is funny! Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections.
Yeah I think the Nevada voting laws are quite odd.  
The voter turnout for us presidential elections hasn’t breached 62.8% in the last 100 years! That’s actually more than I would guess. 
Well, we’ll see how voting will be done twenty years from now, if they make it easier, the numbers will probably rise. 
That’s true. Not all men in the uk had the right to vote until 1918.
I wonder how much fraud there was in voting back in 1918. 
I’m sure a lot. Elections are fairly new. rom 1789 until 1913, Senators were appointed by legislatures of the states they represented; following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, they are now popularly elected. 
That is a very interesting fact.  Do you remember the first time you voted? 
I don’t. it was a long time ago! Women were not allowed to wear pants on the u.s. senate floor until 1993. 
I think that is the strangest fact of the day.  I think it’s wild when observers have to be blocked from polls during elections. 
Strange and freaky! dian government sets up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for a single voter.
I think I’ve read that before! Wild to think about. 
Nice chatting with you. Thanks!
Hey how are you, can’t believe that Georgia senator got arrested!
She said she was peacefully chanting.
That’s interesting, I wish voting was different now, no reason to still have ballots with no federal holiday for Election Day.
It’s interesting that astronauts vote from space! 
For sure, I wonder if it’s confidential up there? How does it get back to earth?
Right, I’ll have to look that up. Indian government sets up a polling booth in a  forest that is full of lions for just one voter.
I wonder if that person even shows up to vote, or why he’s in the jungle like that haha. Did you vote last election?
Yes I did. And even though we don’t have to go to a forest full of lions, voter turnout for US presidential elections has not reached 62.8 percent in the last 100 years.
That’s crazy, I wonder if they’ll ever fix that, plenty of things they can do about that but never attempt it. 
Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election. Hope that’s just a coincidence!
Oh wow, that’s pretty crazy. I’m 6’4", I should run for president lol. 
Ha, maybe you should. Officials in Athens didn’t have much faith in elections. They thought it would lead to oligarchy.
Oh wow, that’s some forward thinking. What is an oligarchy again?
It is where power is concentrated in a small group of people.
Ah I gotcha, they’re kind of right I’m sure. I wonder what the perfect government system is? Any ideas?
Not sure I have faith in any, as all great civilizations come to an end. It seems like we are still barely progressing though. Women could not wear pants in the US senate floor until 1993 after a couple of women senators protested by wearing pantsuits.
Oh wow, that’s crazy how sexist they still were. I agree about the great civilizations coming to an end, they all thought they’d be around forever too.
I think it’s interesting that astronauts vote from space. Yet, we have low turnouts for presidential elections for those of us on earth, haha.
For sure, I wonder why people don’t show up so much, I wish they would more!
Yeah, the Indian government set up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter, that is pretty neat.
Very cool. Great chatting with you, I’m going to take off though, take care!
did you watch the movie Frozen?
I did and loved it so much, and you?
me too. Did you know it is the first movie by disney directed by a woman?
Yes and also that it made $1 billion worklwide, that is amazing
I know. Elsa was the main villain in the original script of the movie
Yes but the let it go song was too uplifting to keep her as the villain
Yes. And the original title of the movie was the Snow Queen
Yes but they changed it because feminine titles do not seem to do well, so sad
That is sad and it is just the mentality that we have to work hard to change
Yup agreed. They also changed Rapunzel to Tangled for that same reason
Yeah. DO you have a pet?
I have two cats and a dog. DO you like dogs?
I love dogs. did you there they can have one of the 12 blood types?
Yes and there are blood drives for dogs
So cool. In istanbul they have installed water and food dispensers for dogs
Yes and all you have to do is feed it plastic bottles
Yes such a genius idea and it helps everyone involved
I know. Dogs are really good at understanding pointing
Yes and same goes for the elephants as well
Yeah. Google is a dog company it seems
Yes they have that in their code of conduct, talk about dedication
I know right, dogs deserve that though
Do you like baseball ?
I have heard of it. Do you?
I like, the sport but there is not MLB team in my city, so I don’t watch it. But I find it really interesting, full of small details, like managers wear a uniform so they could replace a player if they need to. 
That is probably a holdover from the old days when a player was chosen to be manager. Nowadays, it wouldn’t work.
Yes, I wonder if it could be even dangerous for some of them, like some could have an heart attack.  
Yeah, no insurance company would touch the managers on the field, that’s for sure.
I think they would be better at softball, did you ever watch a softball game ? 
I have never watched a softball game, though I understand many women play it. 
I think it is more a hobby than a professional sport, the average salary is around 5500 $ per year, some hobos make more. 
Hobos? I never thought of income in terms of hobos, though I guess they do make money through their illicit means. 
Panhandling can be quite profitable, for someone with no income. Like in a busy place as Manhattan. But even if I don’t consider softball as a legitimate pro sport, if was the first event televised on ESPN.   
Can you win money through betting though? That always legitimizes a sport.
Yes, if it is your criteria, then video game is a legitimate sport. They have leagues and a lot of betting is done on matches. 
Their is a physicality to what they do, but it’s just in the hands.
As shooting, and it is even an Olympic sport, but it is strange to see a smoking fat man winning a medal. Do you play video games ?
I used to play video games. Not much now. Lost interest. Do you? 
Me too, I have lost interest playing before I have lost interest in buy them so I have a backlog of a few games that reminds me  not to buy the next console. It is the more and more popular, 3 billon hours are played on video games each week on Earth. 
Wow. So much time on games. I guess it’s about the same as time spent watching TV.
Yes, but video are viewed more negatively than TV, that is why you have legislation in some countries limiting the time played by children.
It is important to keep the kids from losing themselves in the games. Which countries restrict video games?
There is Korea limiting kids under 16, and China I think. Mostly Asian countries. 
The kids there go nuts over games. I know that there are pro gamers in Korea. Anyway, fun chat!
You too, have a good evening.
Hi there are you a baseball fan?
i like baseball. i usually watch the world series. You?
I’m a fan.  Did you know that baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if needed.
I think that is a holdover from the old days. i bet back then a player was chosen to also be manager.
I’m not sure how that worked.  The last one to do that I remember was Pete Rose back in the late 80’s.  He played every day and managed at the same time.
yeah, he was a competitive guy. probably perfect for the dual role of manager/player.
Up until 2005 a married couple scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year for 24 years!  I bet that could get confusing.
Yeah, i figured that was all done by computer.  I guess they had a pretty sweet gig.
Must have paid pretty good otherwise I don’t think they would have done it for that long.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in grandfathers attic that were hidden since the 1940’s.  He hit the jackpot.
Wow. I would probably sell some, and keep the rest as an investment. What would you do?
I would do exactly the same as you.  How could you not pass that up the chance to set yourself up for life? lol
Yeah, that is quite lucky. Do you follow softball at all?
I actually enjoy watching college softball on ESPNU!
Really? the womens game? do men play as well?
lol I watch the women though because the pitchers really sling that ball to the plate.  On May 11, 1991 Creighton hosted Utah in the longest softball game in NCAA history lasting 31 innings!
Yeah, that underhand pitch can really move. That is one long game! Not much of a career after college though. As of 2014, the average salary for a professional softball player is between $5,000 and $6,000.
No.  Not enough fans to support it. lol  Jose Canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet.  He might have it.  I’ve watched him hitting softballs on youtube.  He crushes them even still to this day.
He had the juice to hit the balls a country mile. I didnt know he played softball. 
Check it out on youtube.  I was shocked at how far the balls go. lol  Kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada! lol It’s been fun chatting!
Yes, it has been fun chatting! Have a good weekend!
You have a great weekend too!
Hi, how are you doing this fine evening?
Hey there I’m doing great. What did you think about the Disney movie Frozen?
I haven’t seen it. Is it a good film? It’s animated, right? With lots of songs?
Yes it uses computer animation and it has love songs. It was super popular. There’s a song that all the little kids were saying called"Let It Go and I guess it’s based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale called the snow queen
HC wrote so many great stories. I read the Snow Queen a long time ago. I don’t remember it.Has the movie won any awards?
I’m pretty sure that it has, I know that it made a ton of money. Apparently the villain used to sing that song I mentioned, Let It Go, but the song was so happy that they changed the character
that’s good thinkg. I bet the song is up for an award somewhere. Who were the people involved in the film?
There’s like a princess, a reindeer and a snowman, they’re like them three most important characters. Also this is the first movie that was produced by Walt Disney and directed by a woman.
Not many films get directed by woman. That’s good that she got the job. Good for Disney! They know how to spot talent.
I think so. Apparently she was the first female director of a film that earned over 1 billion dollars too. So that is another record that she set
Disney has won a ton of awards, and I’m sure she’ll win awards as well.
Oh I’m Sure. Do you like dogs by the way? We used to have a husky ourselves
A dog is a great friend, but no, I have never had a dog. I enjoy playing with them though.
Dogs are awesome, I think anyway, they have like 12 different blood types and apparently there are dog blood drives that exist
I wonder how the dogs are rewarded at the drive. People get cookies and orange juice.
I know right? I hope that the dogs get a treat at least haha. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines that reward stray dogs for bringing back trash?
The Turks know the value of recycling and that dogs are keen to help for reward.
Oh for sure! One other thing I didn’t know is that dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing. I want a pet elephant haha!
Good luck with that elephant! Anyway I enjoyed chatting with you!
I enjoyed chatting with you as well! And yes I’ll go to local pet store and see if they have elephants in stock haha
Have a good night
Thanks you too! And watch out for dogs, they’re not actually colorblind but they just don’t see as many colors as a normal human can
Ana Gloria Henrequez was from Salvador, trying to get to USA, trying to escape from misery and gangs in El Salvador. She was caught.
Yeah, I heard about that. I feel horrible for her young daughter
Sorry, Ana Gloria Henrequez is the grandmother, my bad. Ximena is the girl and the mother is Cindy. They said that they never had been caught until Trump’s laws.
Yeah, I’m not sure if that actually made any difference. It just really sucks that even after his executive order ending the separation reuniting families is still so difficult
Yes, I know. I don’t know how they are not keeping track of what child belongs to what mother. It’s terrible to know that the kids were heard wailing and asking for their family members.
It’s even crazier that the grandmother could recognize Ximena’s voice. I guess since I’ve never been a parent, I can’t comprehend that
You are right. Nobody knows how a parent feels until you are one. Is terrible. I myself I was thinking that I would prefer stay in my country and don’t enter the USA at least while they are taking these measures. It would be terrible to lose my son or grandkid.
I understand that. I can also understand wanting to leave when there are gang members on every corner and your little one is just starting school
Yes, I understand that. It has to be very, very difficult, a terrible decision to make. But, me, personally, I would prefer to face it together than not know what happened to them. I don’t know, this is a very difficult situation.
Plus, she had to leave her dog behind :( Poor little Cookie
Yes, this is such a terrible story. Well, Cindy was robbed twice on the bus. That makes it very difficult to live in a place where you don’t have any safety.
I watched an episode of a TV show Shameless recently and it showed an immigrant child separated from his parents in Texas who ended up in foster care in Chicago!
I wonder why people are adopting them. Praying for them. Have you seen Frozen?
Many are adopting the kids because they want to give them safe homes!
Oh, then, thank you very much. Glad to know about this. God bless them. Well, I liked a lot Frozen. Is a fiery Princess.
yes, it was great movie. And there’s a sequel coming out. I can’t wait!
Hahaha, liked the graphics, tooo!  Do you like dogs? I didn’t know that among dogs they have 12 different blood types!!!!!!!
Yes, and they even have doggy blood drives ^_^ Did the male love interest have a dog or a horse in Frozen? I can’t remember...
Really, me either. I have a bad memory for some things. lol, but I think I will never forget that Minnie Mouse’s name is really Minerva.
Really?! Like the Greek goddess? That’s fascinating to me. Usually Disney tries to "de-feminize" things rather than feminize them more. Frozen was supposed to be named Snow Queen but boys often don’t see movies that have feminine nouns in the title :/
hahahaah that is so much male, lol. Nice to meet you, giving to you an excellent, have a nice day!
Have a lovely day as well :)
Hello my Friend?! Are you a fan of "Frozen" the movie? I personally Looooved it!
I have not seen the movie. Is it animated? Is it for kids?
both! lol, although Im not a kid so I guess for all haha, I did take my kids to see the movie though. It came out in 2013 and earned over 1 billion dollars
That’s great! I must be a wonderful film. It’s a disney film, yes? Lots of songs?
That is correct! produced by Walt Disney Animated Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was so cute! They also remade Rapunzel as Tangled, have you seen that?
I have not. I guess the story is basically the same as the fairy tale? Girl with long hair in a tower?
Yes, another of my favorites! How about you? What do you like to watch?
I enjoy watching comedies and dramas. I sometimes watch animated stuff, but not usually.
Me too, Mysteries or psychological thrillers are great, but animated is one of my favs to watch with kiddos although everyone knows Minnie mouse did you know minnie is short for minerva?! mind blown
I did not know that. I’m not surprised that Disney makes about $1,110 per second. That’s a lot, but reflects the success of the brand.
Oh my! thats awesome! I guess im not too surprised since the company was founded in 1923!
Almost 100 years old. The Mouse House will soon have a century behind it.
Wow, well its maintained its popularity very well! I mean there is a whole subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in all things disney
I’ve never looked for the hidden images, but I imagine they are there! It’s part of the playful nature of the company. It wants to create many layers of fun for the viewers.
Yes, and thus I’m not surprised they’re so succesful. That’s very creative and engaging, and keeps viewers interested and coming back... genius!
It’s ironic that Walt Disney was fired from his job at a local newspaper in Missouri for ’’not being creative enough.’’ I guess his genius was not recognized because he was ahead of his time.
Wow! well see, that’s why I believe in perfect timing sometimes there are better opportunities ahead of us. amazing! 
Are you interested in dogs? They are quite clever. Dogs can learn over a thousand words and  reason better than chimps.
Yes! I sometimes Love them better than people... they are just full of Love. Did you know there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have and dog can donate blood at dog blood drives! I love them even more!
That’s great! They also have ’eureka moments’ and enjoy the experience of solving a problem  to obtain a reward. Much like people!
Yes and they understand by pointing! How cool is that? Thats how I get my dog to get my slippers! Anyway, fun chatting with you! Namaste :)
Have a good evening!
you too
I have never heard of Fanfest,
Hey! What is FanFest? lol
I guess its where the hall of famers meet, At first I thought it said hall of farmers, lol
Ok. I honestly never heard of. Do you play video games?
No, But I did not know they were first designed for the military
It could be for training purpose. I’m wondering why Australia has more banned games than China... It means some US games also banned... It’s quite strange. 
it is like kids in korea being banned playing games after 12
after or before 12? If after 12, why is it so? I used to play a lot when I was child. I’m not surprised that video games make more money abbually than all films from Hollywood.
But would you categorize them as an art form?
Interesting question. I don’t think this is any sort of art. It could be kind of sport. I more support this point of view. How about you? What’s your opinion?
I really not did get into them, But I would consider them an art form
It could be. At the same time it would be easy to define popularity of such art. For example, it could be a reason why the rating system was involved in video games.
Maybe I will just go to the fanfest and try the Pitching tunnels, can you throw well
Ok. Do you watch or play any sport? Like softball or baseball?
I only play have you heard of any of these players like, Davey Johnson?
Yes. He played in 1970s, right? Or maybe 1960s... I don’t remember.
I have no clue, But I love the name Rollie Fingers.
Baseball is fun to watch. I like it. However, I always have difficulties to hit a ball hahaha 
maybe you should go to the show you can get a medal Maybe
Medal would be too much significant achievement. The Chicago Cubs were the first to win back-to-back world series and haven’t won since. My luck is about the same lol
Thank you for your time but I must go now
Have a good day! Thanks.
bye
bye!
Hey how are you? Did you see the FanFest in Miami last year by chance?
No I didn’t see that. It’s interesting that 23 former Nationals attended it though, did you see it?
Yah, it was pretty cool. I didn’t catch who the olympic gold medalists were, did you? They said there were two of them there.
No I didn’t catch their names. But I know that a lot of gold medalist attended as well as some people from the US Olympic softball team, I don’t watch sports or the Olympics so I can’t say that I know any of the names LOL
Me neither, I wish I knew more about the olympians, they’re so elite. Hard for them to get a lot of recognition though. You play video games by chance?
Yes I play video games somewhat, used to play Maurice a kid but I don’t play that many these days. What about you? I’m just glad that I didn’t grow up in South Korea because apparently playing a video game after midnight if your under 16 is illegal
Oh wow, I would have never of guessed that. I played a lot of video games growing up, I think there is a lot of benefit to them. I play Fortnite now, and I’m in my 30s lol. Do you still play?
LOL I have heard of the game but I have never played it. I do know that they did a study and apparently as a planet we play about 3 billion hours of video games a week so I definitely should be playing more perhaps haha
I could definitely see that. What were your favorite video games? Jane McGongiai was the game designer behind that study, pretty cool.
Well I really liked the Nintendo 64 and I also like the original Xbox, it’s interesting that I played a Toy Story game back in the day and it wasn’t actually Tom Hanks who did the voice but his brother Jim Hanks
Wow, I’m surprised they have such similar voices. I went the Sega to Playstation route, still rocking the PS4, no Toy Story game though.
Yeah the PlayStation 4 is cool. I’m just glad that we called him video games and not their original name which was the cathode ray tube Amusement device LOL
I like video game a lot more than Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices lol, dang military always overcomplicating things.
I agree with you. Did you ever play the video game LittleBigPlanet or Harry Potter? Apparently the same person did the narration in both of those video games, his name is Stephen Fry
Stephen Fry from Top Gear?
I’m not sure if it’s the same guy, I don’t know Top Gear personally, but it could be, do you ever play softball by the way or watch it on TV?
I hear Stephen Fry’s name all the time, he must be super famous in the UK. I don’t, you going to spit some softball knowledge my way?
Haha yes I can do that. It’s interesting that the softball is bigger than a baseball because it is about 12 in in circumference, I’ve never played softball but that seems like a really big ball lol
Yah, it’s quite a bit larger than a baseball for sure, I’ve never seen a softball video game though, have you?
No I’ve never seen one actually. It’s interesting though that the average salary for a professional softball player is at most $6,000 LOL definitely you’re not retiring on that money
Oh wow, definitely not! Anyways, I am going to get going, great chatting with you, take care and have a great night!
Yes it’s been an excellent chat! And make sure to try out a baseball video game once in awhile, they are actually pretty fun
Hi, how are you?
Good! You?  Are you into Fiction at all?
A little and I prefer non-fiction. Do you like it?
I read mainly non fiction too,  but I can get in to some of it. I think it is cool that there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.
I find that useful too! Edgar allen poe wrote about a cyborg, the oldest example of it.
Wow, that is kind of neat.  I thought that was a more modern invention.
Me too. Julius Ceasar wrote fan fiction too!
Wow.  Id like to see what came out of his mind!
I guess it was about Hercules and Oedipus. George RR MArtin would not have liked that!
Yeah, he things it is copyright infringement.  I dont exactly agree with that.
I don’t either. Imagine being the racist judge who tried to ban a comic book because of a black guy in it.
That is really kind of ridiculous.  I cant even believe that happens.
I know. I cannot believe people want to upload their minds to computers!
That is odd.  I dont want my innermost thoughts to be displayed anywhere.  
There’s a reason I buried my skeletons deep! I wonder if it runs on water like the Russians did in 1936?
Yeah, that is pretty fascinating.  I wonder why we arent exploring that technology more.
They were too busy building a 16-bit computer using minecraft blocks!
I cant believe that was even possible.  I thought minecraft was just a game.  That is crazy
Right? I wonder who built it too? I wish my son could do that stuff. But not smoking. Smoking near an apple computer voids the warranty.
Good thing I never smoked near mine.  They think it makes it a "biohazard"
Agreed! Nice chatting with you!
hey there, do you go out and vote during elections?
Hello there, I do like to get out and vote, how about you?
me too. do you know way back then though how people were appointed in ancient athens?
I guess they were appointed by a lottery of some type.  I think they believed that elections would lead to an oligarchy. 
I wonder how that would work today though.
Yeah I don’t think that would work very well, but then again, maybe it would work better, who knows. 
yeah there is no knowing there. In Nevada they have a none of these candidate options in the ballot.
Yeah I heard that there were some wild results in the Nevada elections this year. 
I did not know about that one. not a lot of people seems to vote though since less than 63 people go out and vote
Isn’t that pretty sad, I guess it hasn’t breached that 63% barrier in the last 100 years!
yes it is because it is a right and we are not using it to its best.
That is true.  Did you know that the taller candidate has won the presidential election 75% of the time?
hahaa I really wonder if that has any correlation with how people perceive the candidates
Yeah I guess it must, because that is just way too high to just be chance. 
did you hear that international electoral observers were blocked from polls in nine states in 2012
No I didn’t hear that, I wonder why they stopped doing that? 
maybe they did not trust them, i have no idea. do you know when republicans and democrats started using red and blue?
No I don’t, but probably more than 100 years ago or so, do you know?
It was actually as recently as 2000 so not very long ago.
Really, wow I am really bad at politics I guess.  
I did not know it either until now. It was nice chatting with you.
Poetry is an art that is getting forgotten
It is one of those that I feel like I don’t always understand, but love to hear the analysis of and see how deep it can get.  For instance, there is a poem where if you read it one way it’s sad, but read it in reverse and it’s actually inspirational!
Wow, I bet that poem required a lot creativity, wrtting a poem with completely different meanings, oposing genres, genius
There is one guy that wrote a poem of over 220 words in palindrome (where it is the same backwards and forwards -- like "nurses run")!
Sounds really hard, did you ever read one of Edgar Allan Poe’s poems?
I think I read a couple.  I feel like I know them so well because of horror and Halloween stories.  I know "The Raven" was pretty popular.  Do you think he made a lot of money with that poem?
Not really in fact he only made $9 for the publication of that poem, seems really underpaid
Wow!  That is crazy!  I hope he had a good day job.  Maybe just regular fiction works would have been better financially.
I hope he did as well, the raven is like his most popular poem and selling it for $9, business was slow, he also wrote cyborg fiction,
That’s pretty cool.  If he’d had a black character in it in the 1950s that was worthy of banning a science fiction comic!
That sounds really racist, theres a wiki rank of fictional characters according to power and abilities,  I wonder who is the strongest hero
Maybe like a Superman type or Hercules?  Funny thing, future emperor Julius Caesar actually wrote Hercules based fan fiction when he was younger.  I wonder what that was like.
I bet it was pretty good, it was about Hercules and Oedipus, I wonder if he was good.
Game of Thrones author, George RR Martin, might not have cared for it.  Maybe Caesar would get a pass, but Martin doesn’t care for fan fiction at all!
Yeah I heard he hated fan fiction, he doesnt care about it at all so changing the subject a bit do you use computers a lot?
It seems like that is what I do the vast majority of my day.  I’m not ready to upload my mind to a computer or memory stick like transhumanists, but it is like an extension of me some days.
I agree theres so much we dont understand about the human mind, Transhumanist must be missing key elements of the human essence.
Are you a PC or a Mac?  Be warned that being a smoker an an apple computer user could actually void the warranty as they see it as a biohazard if someone smokes by it.  I am neither, but that’s beside the point.
I have a mac and I dont smoke but its good  to know, seems kind of random to void a warranty because of that, 
Maybe they should have tried to make a water-based computer, which apparently the Russians were able to make in 1936.  I do wonder what sort of "computer" that was though.
I wonder if they still make computers that ran on water, not sure is the best idea to mix water with tech
Do you like to use computers? 
Yes I love computers. I can’t imagine my life without one. In 1936 the Russians made one that ran on water.
Interesting. If you think about it, a lot of power comes from water. 
Yes such as hydropower. Apple computer’s seem to be quite sensitive because if you smoke near an Apple Computer it voids the warranty.
Interesting. That doesn’t sound true, but I wonder if it is the same for the iphone?
I don’t know what you mean? There is a group called transhumanist’s that want to upload their minds to computers and memory sticks!
That sounds pretty cool. I would do it, would you? 
I don’t know sounds kind of creepy to me! Almost like the work of fiction! Like something from someones imagination!
I think it would be pretty cool. Do you play minecraft? 
I have in the past. Kind of amazing someone built a working computer using only the mine craft building blocks.
Yeah, that is pretty crazy. I’m not even sure how that is possible? 
Me neither. I also don’t know how the space shuttles general-purpose computer runs on 1 Mb of RAM.
I’m not sure either. It seems like a small amount of ram. 
Yes it does. Do you like reading fiction? I kind of like reading things that are not based on history or facts.
I’m not a huge fan of fiction. Did you know there is a wiki that ranks fictional characters based on powers? 
I would like to see that. Edgar Allan Poe wrote the oldest known example of cyborgs in fiction.
That would be pretty cool. I wonder what the best fictional character is on the wiki? 
Yes I bet superman is up there. Probably Thor too. Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules in his youth. He definitely got started early.
Superman definitely has to be up there if not number one. Well nice chatting with you!
A judge in the 1950s tried to ban a work of science fiction because it featured a black character. Glad times have changed. Nice talking to you too!
Nice chatting with you too!
Hi and good afternoon. Are you a poetry fan? It has a long history dating back to prehistoric times.
Hi, how are you? i am not a big fan of poetry. Are you?
I think it’s fun to read sometimes. The origins are more interesting for me. Early poems in the Eurasian content evolved from folksongs. 
I dont much about poetry. that is interesting. i guess poetry and songs would be closely related.
Yes I suppose they would. They tried to define poetry in ancient Greece such as Aristotle’s poetics. It focused on the use of speech in rhetoric, drama, song, and comedy.
I guess poetry is spoken and written, so it is related to many arts. Do you have a favorite poet?
I think it’s funny when comedians do poetry. I don’t really have a favorite poet. Demetri Martin wrote a 224 word palindrome!
that must have taken him quite a while. 224 words, backwards and forwards? my head hurts.
Yes mine hurts just thinking about it. Edgar Allan Poe is another classic poet and he only received $9 for the publication of his poem the Raven.
He probably spent it on drugs and booze too. the man was so decadent, but maybe it inspired him.
Yeah you probably did. I love the hobbit too. Most of the character names were taken out of an old Icelandic poem called dvergatal.
Yes, Tolkien loved old languages. he studied them and learned to speak some of them. 
That is so fascinating, I love his works of fiction. I like fiction because it is so imaginative. What is your favorite genre?
I like non fiction because i want to keep up with what is going on in the world. 
That’s good and definitely practical. The author of game of thrones despises fan fiction because he says it is copyright infringement and not a good exercise for aspiring writers. I kind of see where he’s coming from.
the fans should try to write their own stories, not rehash someone else’s. 
Exactly. I think it’s so funny authors used have to write on old typewriters. Now they have computers which can basically carry out any sequence of arithmetic or logical operations.
Yes, the typewriter changes the relationship between the writer and the prose. i figure that the computer makes my writing different.
Yes probably mine as well now that you mention it. If you have an Apple computer make sure you don’t smoke near it because it voids the warranty. Very nice talking with you this afternoon.
What about vaping? is vaping ok? LOL Yes, i enjoyed chatting!
Ha ha that is very important information I need to know too! Have a good afternoon.
Hello there, do you use Amazon?
Yes, I like Amazon, I like their movie site and their purchase website.
Yeah I use their delivery service quite a bit, especially around Christmas. 
Amazon is a super large company, did you know chief executive own the Washington Post?
No I didn’t know that.  Do you know how much the first ever Amazon purchase was for?
No I don’t know, do you have any idea, if yes how much was the first purchase?
Yeah it was for $27.95 and it was for the rights to name a building after themselves. 
Wow, I will always respect Amazon, because they offer thousandth of people employment rather or not they except it.
Yeah they do, do you know that the US postal service has a contract with Amazon to deliver on Sundays?
No I didn’t know that, but I notice they Improve their delivery services to only a few days before receiving their packages.
Yeah they do.  On a different note, do you know much about sharks?
No, I don’t, but I know there are different kind of sharks and they behave in different ways. I like seen them on TV, but not in real life.
Yeah I only know a little bit, I do know that because they have no bones on land, a sharks weight would crush its own body. 
most people think that all sharks are killer sharks, but I read that all shark aren’t killer sharks. Have you seen the movies about sharks?
No, just tv shows about them.  I think the Greenland shark and 5 gilled sharks are the most interesting.  The Greenland sharks live for a crazy amount of time!
Yes you are right, I didn’t know sharks didn’t have ribs. I wonder how they upstand attacks from other animals from the waters?
Yeah isn’t that interesting.  I guess they also evolved earlier than dinosaurs as well. 
every show played on TV, always wonder how dolphins kill sharks? I notice dolphins always attack from the side.
Yeah I think you are right on that.  Dolphins are so interesting to me on how they communicate with each other. 
Did you know sharks can be trained to bark like a dog?
Really? That is crazy, I wonder who thought of even trying that.  Well it was good talking with you, I hope you have a good night. 
Hello friend, Do you like horses?
I do. Did you know horses are able to sleep standing up and lying down?
Yes, that is cool. Did you know that the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large single-toed animal of today? 
That makes it even more impressive that there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world today.
Yes, humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Some species were domesticated but then some are still living in the wild as feral horses.
I just heard that Icelandic horses have a fifth gear. Horses are simply fascinating.
Yes, I agree. There is an extensive specialized vocabulary used to described equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.
What do you think about sharks? Did you know they’re sister species to rays?
Yes, fascinating fact!. And sharks can be trained like dogs to bark.
I kinda feel bad for them. They have no rib cages so if they ever end up on land, they get crushed by the weight of their body.
Yes, sad indeed. Sharks even evolved earlier than dinosaurs and trees.
Have you ever seen the white shark cafe? It’s where white sharks meet in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
No, I’ve never seen it but I have heard about it.  Did you know that not just dolphins rescue sailors, but sharks too?
I did know that. Animals cease to amaze me. We have to protect them at all costs.
I agree. Do you do any online shopping on Amazon.com? Amazon sells almost everything from A to Z.
I do. Did you know Amazon started as an online bookstore?
Yes, and then they later diversified to sell video downloads, MP3 downloads, audiobooks downloads, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys, and jewelry. Wow.
Have you read anything about Amazon’s proposed second HQ?
No, I did know that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years, though.
I did know. I don’t really understand a lot of what Jeff Bezos does. That money could’ve been used better elsewhere.
That could be. Maybe, he makes up for it by keeping his employees healthy.  Amazon warehouse workers walk between 7 and 15 minutes a day as part of their shift.  Nice chatting with you.
Hey! I’ve been reading a lot lately. Do you read any fiction or poetry?
Hi! Hm. I don’t read much fiction or poetry, but I’ve been exposed to a lot of it in my lifetime. Do you have any favorites? I’ve tried my hand at creating both, and failed miserably! It’s tough! It’s an art form, that I just can’t do!
I’ve been more into poetry lately. It’s fascinating that it’s been around since prehistorical times, with hunting poetry in Africa. 
Oh it’s fascinating, for sure! Even more so to me since it eludes my abilities. heh. I’ve read that there is a poem which when read forwards is depressing, and when read backwards is inspiring! I’d really like to read it, but I can’t find anything more about it, as of yet.
That is fascinating. Similarly, Demetri Martin once wrote a 224 word palindrome poem. 
Oh wow! Now there is a poem, I forgot that I loved! The Raven, by Edgar Allen Poe. It’s been so long since I’ve heard it! I mean like 20+ years! Something about The Raven rap-tap-tapping on his door, or floor? Haha. I heard he only got $9 for the publication of that poem! Go figure.
Wow! Just $9?! Somebody got a bargain! Did you know Edgar Allen Poe also wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction? Pretty diverse author, isn’t he?
Oh yeah? What an interesting person he must have been, in general! I don’t even know what Javanese is , but apparently their alphabet when recited in order, is a poem. The ABC’s are pretty poetic to me, now that we recite them so sing-songy.
I wonder what kind of poems a computer could come up with? Computers do everything else, they can control microwave ovens, remote controls, robots...why not write poetry, right?
Haha! I’m slightly certain that soon, they will write poetry. Computers have come such a long way! I found something really interesting, in 1936 the Russians made a computer that ran off of water! I wonder what went wrong with that. Maybe electricity and water wasn’t the best idea?
Computers can be fairly delicate, I suppose. Smoking near apply computers voids the warranty by making it "a biohazard". What in the world could that mean?
Hm.. Yeah I know that smoking near them, just really clogs everything up, kind of taking dust and mixing it with the tarry nicotine and it creates a huge mess and can break a computer and completely stop the fans and such, but bio-hazard? I’m interested to learn why that is. Kinda scary!
Someone built a working 16 bit computer using nothing but the basic Minecraft building blocks. I wonder what kind warranty that one has?!
Haha! Woah! There’s a thing called transhumanists I guess, and they want to upload their brains to computers and memory sticks! I don’t want to do that! One lifetime is okay by me. I can only imagine the torment of a mind having to just live for possibly forever! Yikes!
I agree! What if people tried to read my mind’s unpublished poetry! No thank you! I have some interesting fan fiction in my head, just like Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Hercules and Oedipus. But that’s private!
Haha! I am quite happy keeping my thoughts to myself! It sounds like a scary sci-fi movie to me! My computer brain gets arrested and imprisoned for eternity in 100 years for some crazy new law! No thank you!
How much memory would it take to store all of us, anyway? Maybe less than I think. A space shuttle can run on 1mb of RAM. 
That’s crazy! Precisely why I’m not an astronaut! I wouldn’t want to do crazy things such as trust my life to 1mb of ram! 
Haha! There’s a good science fiction  book, The Martian, which has some interestin parts about computers and space shuttles. That author had a pretty good imagination. 
Woah! In the 50’s a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because it featured a black character! Thank goodness, we’ve come a long way from that hatefulness. But still we have a ways to go, before things are truly equal, really for all races.
Thank goodness, indeed. I agree with you, though, there is still progress to be made, and I think reading diverse fiction and poetry can help people see things from other perspectives. 
Oh absolutely! Really all art forms and most certainly the internet is going to bring humanity together on a much more even playing field. It was really nice talking with you!
Hello! Are you an Amazon Prime member?
Yes, I am and love it!  That two day delivery really comes in handy!!
It really does! Even Sunday delivery rocks especially since Amazon contracted with the USPS.
Yes, I think that was good for the USPS!  How would you like to have a building named after yourself for being a customer and only spend $27.95?
If only I knew about it years ago!!!!! I didn’t realize they own IMDB as well!
I know, I didn’t either!  Thinking the amazon warehouse workers don’t need a gym membership with walking 7-15 miles each day on a shift! Omg!
I would be the fittest man alive working there haha. They ought to use horses there! Especially Icelandic horses that can speedwalk!
Ha, ha, ha, Yes!! Good idea, I love horses, Guess you can’t ride your horses to school on, no vehicle day or you can get suspended.
Oh I know I saw that two high school students did that! I remember kids would drive their tractors to my high school!
Oh really, Wow! Did you know Clint Eastwood is allergic to horses, after riding all those horses in the movies?
You would have never guessed since he rode like hundreds of them! He should have rode sharks instead!
Well, I guess sharks have been around a long time. Makes sense they were here before the trees and dinosaurs!!
Crazy to think that is one long time! I didn’t know they could be trained like dogs to bark!
  I didn’t know that either. I would like to hear that. I will have to look that up!
They already sound a lot smarter than me haha. I always wondered why dalmatians were used at firehouses.
I know, isn’t it good they helped calm and protect the  horses back then. Aren’t Lipizzaner horses beautiful!!
Yes I think it was! It all makes sense to me now haha. They really are. I don’t know many animals or things that can change colors of their skin!
Yes it only takes about 6 years, and give great classical dressage performances!
I would love to see them in real life! I’m good with sharks though although I just snorkeled with some last month!
Really, very cool! I love to snorkel too! The coral reefs are so spectacular!!
They really are! Well it was nice chatting with you have a good night!
Hey there, heard anything interesting lately? I sure have, did you know Amazon contributed 38 billion to the city of Seattle’s economy just by being there? 
Hi, no I did not know. It looks like amazon means exciting news. They are now looking for a site for a second headquarters!
That’s great! Not everyone thinks so though, Amazon can come with difficulties in transportation and shoot up the housing costs of whatever city it’s in. 
They do make an impact wherever they go. I found interesting that there is a building named after the first amazon.com customer
I heard they’re considering Washington as a place for their 2nd HQ, wherever they put the building is going to get a huge boost! I heard they’re even considering New York!
Also Los angeles, atlanta, and Dallas. they are looking for as much as 8 million sq ft
Don’t forget about their original HQ, it was founded by Jeff Bexos on July 5 1994. And it’s the largest internet retailer in the world! 
An in the US they are the most valuable company after Apple and Microsoft, they have really grow so much!
It’s probably thanks to their hard-workers! I heard they walk 7-15 miles each day as apart of their shift.
that is a lot!
And the CEO Jeff Bezos built a clock into a mountain that should run for 10,000 years! I guess he has the money to do so!
We can’t deny he is full of great ideas. i did not know that IMBD is owned by amazon!!
Me neither! Amazon seems to have a lot of power, they have a contract with the post-office to make sure our packages get delivered even on Sunday!
that is neat. Did you know they started with being an online bookstore?
That’s incredible, they also have a publishing arm known as Amazon publishing for people who want to publish their eBooks through them!
that is good! Hey, do you like animals?
I love animals, my favorite is the Shark. Did you know they can be trained just like dogs? Talk about man’s best friend.
Di you know that they meet in the pacific ocean, in a place named "white Shark cafe". I love coffee but I would try not to end up there!
Crazy, but what’s even crazier is that Shark’s have no rib cages! If they were on land they’d be crushed by the weight of their own body. 
We are all afraid and even terrified of sharks, but it looks like they can rescue sailors!
That’s probably because they evolved earlier than Dinosaurs, nature’s perfect killer!
Crazy! there a very small ones. there is one called small dwarf lantershark. and it has a lenght of 17 cms. well it was so nice talking to you!!
Good morning.
good morning
Do you keep up with the election?
yeah, but moderately.  You?
yes, about the same. I know there are the republican and democrat party.
the only election that I follow is the Presidential Election
Same here. I don’t follow local as I do not live in the same state more than 3 years at a time.
I see. Do you know who has a higher authority than a state’s governor?
I think state senator. DId you know there hasn’t been a president that wasn’t a republican or democrat since 1853
Very interesting.  Was this President an independence in your opinion?
I think so. I dont know if any green party have ever been elected. Did you know all presidents with beards have been republican.?
Just know about this fact by now.  Which party do you think will win the next Presidential Electin?
I think the republicans will win. Do you think someone will run against Trump on the republican ballot next time?
I believe the current Texas’s governor, but I do not remember his name
Ancient Athens did their appointment by lottery instead of election.
It is weird, but true
The Beatles song "come together" was written for a California governor.
There somehow was a connection between Beatles band and California politics.
Did you know North Dakotas governor declared martial law in 1934 and seceded from the U.S
I did not know about this fact.  I am wondering if it is still in effect.  By the way, nice chatting with you
You too. I do not think its in effect though.
hi are you a republican?
No I am not. How about you?
No I am not, I am a Libertarian. Maybe one of us will win soon, it hasn’t happened since 1853.
Well I am just hoping Trump doesn’t win a second term next year, but with how corrupt everything is now it is looking like a very likely outcome.
I do too, I don’t particularly like him. Did you vote last election
I did, I voted Hillary even though I didn’t really care for her either, but she was a much better choice than what we ended up with.
For sure, I voted third party. I was part of the problem, I wanted a 3rd party to win because it has been years!
Well Bernie Sanders just announced his 2020 run, so if he actually makes it onto the ballot this year I will vote for him.
Yea, he got taken out of the running in 2016 by hillary. I am voting BIDEN!
If Biden decided to run in 2020 i would probably choose him over Bernie, I always liked him when he was VP.
For sure, and he would take Trump down.
I am not sure anyone can take Trump down at this point, with all the rumored election rigging and ties to Russia, I personally think he will just cheat to win again and no one will do anything about it, just like these last 4 years.
Right, I figured the same thing! I don’t think he’s good and if he wins I think we know for sure it was rigged.
Well one problem is the election is based on the electoral college more than actual peoples votes. If we could get rid of the electoral college and get back to the popular vote, like it should be, he wouldn’t even have won the first time.
For sure. They should do it like athens did back in the day. Use a lottery system to prevent oligarchy! I think he is cheating the system
Yep and nothing is being done about it. Bill Clinton cheated on his wife and every one through a fit and started impeachment proceedings, but Trump supposedly gets away with treason and it really grinds my gears.
For sure, and cheating on his wife a bunch of times!
yeah Clinton was not a good husband but he was a pretty darn good president, I will never understand why his personal life mattered to so many people, and then when it looks like we have an actual traitor in the seat no one seems to care.
for sure, people made good money and the economy was great! Good chatting with you!
Yeah same to you, good chat.
bye!
Hello, do you follow politics much?
Hi I do from time to time, it is hard to escape them all together. Did you know every republican president has had a beard? 
Oh pretty cool fact. And since 1853 the president has been either a republican or a democrat
Wow pretty dominant. THey did not start using the colors red and blue until 2000, I thought it was earlier than that
Yeah it does feel late, you are right. Did you hear about Truman and his refusal to take a photo on the dumbo ride?
Yeah he just id not want to be associated with Republicans in any way, shape or form and the dumbo is their logo
Yup pretty much. DO you know how officials were elected in ancient athens?
Yes by lottery, and I wonder how that would work nowadays probably a mess
Hahah agreed. In Nevada you have the options to not vote for any of the candidates, I like that
Me too, I wish it were in all the states. Too bad not a lot of people show up at the polls though
Yeah I hope we can go past that almost 63%. We need to all vote
Yes I agree. Since 1990 it seems the taller candidate has been winning the election. Coincidence?
Hmm interesting one. DO you know what the Beatles song Come together was written for?
Yeah it was for the California governor Timothy Leary in 1969
Yeah that one. When Schwarzenegger was governor of California he did not live in Sacramento and commuted ever day
But he did not have it rough, he travelled by private jet 3 hours each day
Good for him I guess. North Dakota governor declared martial law in 1934
Yes and then seceded from the US. WOw
In Texas, the first female governor was elected before other stated had ratified the amendment
Nice, seems they were a bit more ahead of time/. Ralph Lawrence  Carr was the only governor that did not agree with the internment of japane americans during WWII
Must have been tough being the only guy.
The Republican Party is really popular in the states do you agree?
Unfortunately yes.  It is not like the republican party of old times.
Yeah a lot of things have changed, funny anecdote with Truman and Dumbo though
That is a good one.  Poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt realize what was happening.  They should have brought out Eeyore instead.
I know right Dumbo didnt have the fault lol, I bet he isnt a Republican either,
Probably not.  He might wear blue for all we know.
So the red and blue colors, seem like they have been around forever but its a recent thing from the year 2000
That is surprising!  I feel like they have always been there as far back as I can remember.
It sure seems like a lot longer, so elections are really important Im just glad we have that choice many countries dont
Very true, which is why it is surprising election turnout hasnt gotten above 63%
And thats how we end up with leaders like Trump lol, also the taller candidate wins 75% of the time, interesting stat
So we need to find someone taller than him for 2020.  Lets start searching now. lol
We sure do lol, did you know Nevada is the only state with the option ’’None of these’’
They have that?  Ok... im kinda jealous now.
They do, seems like the best option at times lol
It really does.  
I think one of the best governors is Schwarzenegger would be cool to have the terminator as president one day
It really would1
He is a great actor but also a great politician, he has done a lot for California and is a really popular guy
He really has.  Did you know he commuted by private jet each day, 3 hours!
Sounds like a really busy guy, anyways its time for lunch, its been great chatting with you but Im taking a break, thanks a lot
What did you think of the last couple elections?
I think it has been great for the country. people have come to realize the power of the vote.
That is a great point. I want to keep seeing more and more voter turnout. It hasn’t been more than 62.8 percent in 100 years
the vote should be mandatory. then people would see the power of the ballot.
I agree, I am sure other countries do that. I don’t think we should go back to how ancient athens did it, do you know how?
i think they used a lottery. that would help avoid power falling into certain hands consistenly.
yea and hoping the lottery would not allow an oligarchy. I wonder if that worked or not
it probably slowed it down. officials can still bribed, even randomly elected ones.
Yea you’re right. I am sure it was rigged. How do you like Republicans?
well, they can be bribed after the fact once elected. The country has shifted farther right, so they are pretty far right now.
Yea that is a good point. is your governer part of that far right?
no, i dont think so. i think that the far right is usually in the south. 
Yea I think so too, our governor is republican but not a far right one. There was only one governor who opposed internment of japanese people in ww2
yeah, during wartime it is hard to stop people from acting on hate. i expect that could happen again soon if there is war with chna.
for sure, I am sure something big will happen in our lifetime. It is bound to happen. I still can’t believe schwarzenegger was governor
he had notoriety to launch a campaign. if you are rich, famous, tall, etc you can run for govt. i figure the future is all about marketing, not content.
He was the terminator! That is all he needed! lol
yeah, the governator. he was not a good speaker but people knew him. he didnt get much done because he didnt understand politics.
For sure, I would have voted for him if I was in california, even though he ruined the state. 
people that should run government do not run for office. if they run for office, we probably dont want them in there.
I agree with you. It was so nice chatting with you!
No. I think it’s so interesting that the Republican Party is referred to as the Grand old party.
I agree.  I wonder why they gave themselves that moniker.  
Yeah I’m not sure. But every US president with a beard has been Republican.
True.  I also heard that Hillary Clinton was president of the young republicans when she was in college.
Oh that’s interesting especially given the fact that she just ran Democrat. The red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats only started in 2000.
That really got me.  I thought they were always around representing the parties.  
Yeah me too but it sounds like they used to use animals more. Truman seem to take that very seriously especially at Disneyland.
I heard... poor Dumbo.  He probably didnt even understand.
Ha ha yeah I bet he was so confused. It’s funny to think that ride has been around since 1957.
It really is, it was my favorite as a kid, much to the detriment of my parents.  LOL
Haha thats funny. Apparently officials in ancient athens were appointed by lottery because they believe elections would lead to oligarchy.
Well elections also lead to a dog being elected mayor... so I dont know what is worse.
Haha yes good point. I hope that one day the voter turnout for presidential elections will breach 63%.
Me too.  Did you know the faster blinker has lost every election since 1980.  Who even calculates that data.
Yeah that is definitely an odd stat.
There is even a cat that placed 3rd in the Virginia Senate election.  How can animals even run?  That is just crazy
Haha i guess you can vote for anything. Like blinking, another odd stat is the tallest candidate has won in 75% of elections.
So we need to look for a slow blinker and a tall person for 2020.
Yeah they will no doubt win! Nevada is actually the only state to have a "none of these" candidates voting option.
That is brilliant, especially if it forces new candidates.
Yea more states should do it maybe. More states should elect women too. Texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment!
Do you follow politics?
I do. I just learned that the Republican Party was founded by anti-slavery activists. Surprising.
I never knew that.  There hasn’t been a US president who wasn’t a Republican or Democrat since 1853.
That’s a good thing! Did you know in 1957 President Harry Truman visited Disneyland and refused to be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wouldn’t be associated with the Republican Party?
That’s funny!  Consistent use of the red and blue colors for Republicans and Democrats started in 2000.  Could have swore they used those colors before then.
Really? I thought so too! Did you know Nevada is the only state to have a "none of these candidates" voting option for Presidential elections?
I didn’t know that.  Every US president with a beard has been a Republican.  Interesting.
Huh. I never noticed! Hard to believe voter turnout for US Presidential elections hasn’t breached 62.8% in the last 100 years.
That’s an amazing statistic.  Wow.  Since 1900 the taller candidate has won the US presidential election 75 percent of the time.
Oh that is funny! During the 2012 US elections international electoral observers were blocked from the polls in 9 states.
Interesting.  Do you ever vote for the governor in your state?  I do.
I do. Can you believe when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor of CA he never lived in Sacramento, instead he commuted 3 hours every day by private jet.
Didn’t know that.  I bet that would get old though flying like that every day.
It is certainly a lot. Did you know the Beatles song Come Together was actually written for Tim Leary’s 1969 CA Governor campaign.
I had no idea.  Wonder why a British band at the time would write a song for an American election?  Interesting.
Very! Did you know Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only Governor to oppose the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2?
I didn’t know that.  I’ve heard about when they did that though to those people.
It’s something else, that’s for sure.
In 1934 I see that North Dakota’s governor declared martial law and seceded from the US.  I’m learning all kinds of new things today.
Wow! Well, Texas elected their first female Governor, the second in the nation, before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. 
Looks like Texas was ahead of the times!  Thanks for chatting!
Are you aware that the taller candidate for president has won 75% of the elections of them time. 
Hello - it doesn’t surprise me. I’ve even heard that taller people in interviews for jobs tend to get the job more often.
Crazy, is that true? 
Not sure how true it is, but that’s what I’ve been told. Did you know Hillary Clinton was president of young republicans in college?
I’m not surprised. Did you know Arnold traveled 3 hours a day to Sacramento when he was the governor? 
Wow that’s crazy. I can’t imagine traveling that far for work. 
Me either. Did you know Tim Leary ran for governor of CA? 
I did not know that, but that’s interesting. I didn’t know congress has played a democrat vs. republican baseball game every year since 1909. 
I did, it must be one boring game! 
Yea I bet it is a very boring game. A cat named Hank placed third in a Virginia senate election once before. 
I can believe it. Did you know Nevada is the only stat that has a none of these candidates as a voting option? 
Wow I didn’t know that about Nevada. 
Yeah, must be an interesting state to live in. Have you ever visited there? 
I have been to Las Vegas twice. What about you?
Yeah, I’ve been. But I don’t think a majority of the people that visit there vote. 
Yea, I’m not too sure on that. I saw that all elections conducted in Oregon are conducted by mail.
Interesting. It rains a lot in Oregon, have you ever visited? 
Never been to Oregon, but not a state I think I would want to live in with all of the rain they get. 
Yeah, I’m not a huge fan of rainy states to be honest. 
Me either. Did you know the government of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool?
No, weird. Is a hew a professional swimmer? 
Do you watch many movies in the theaters?
Yes I love watching movies! Summer was considered a bad time to release a movie in the theater because of low sales until steven spielberg’s jaws.
Steven spielberg still makes millions from star wars off a bet with george lucas they made in 1977!
haha thats awesome,  I wonder what the bet was.Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack. 
I was wondering the same! After filming the goonies steven spielberg flew the entire cast to hawaii and surprised director richard donner with a cookout.
Amazing!  Thats so nice. When steven spielberg rode jurassic park the ride on opening day he requested that he was let off before the 84 foot drop
Too funny! Speaking of entertainers that make a lot of money, With over $8.5 billion worldwide film earnings, tom hanks is the highest all-time box office star.
He is very talented. Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after sleeping beauty was a box office failure.
Good thing they didn’t! Disney’s "treasure planet" was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.
yeah,  I read that recently,  I never saw it.  The movie trojan wars with a budget of $15,000,000 has earned only $309 in box office
Yikes! The silence of the lambs came out on valentine’s day in 1991 and had a box office of over $270 million.
That movie was great and creepy at the same time.  
Super creepy. Spielberg became a household name as the director of Jaws.
Did you know that More than 80 percent of the earth’s natural forests have already been destroyed
That’s sad. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered with water.
Also, When earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long.  Such short days!  i wouldnt mind going to work for only 2 hours lol 
That would be great! If earth’s entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.
Mind blown!  I love these facts! In september of 2010, the united nations appointed official ambassador to extraterrestrials in they case they would ever make contact with earth
What?! Thats funny. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
The earth is old!  Earth will be virtually helium-free by the end of the 21st century
Wow. The majority of Earth’s polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. 
was good talking to you!
Did you ever watch ET?
Yes, I did.  It was the movie when I was a kid!
Seems like Steven Spielberg is trying to return to his glory with Ready Player One. Have you seen that?
No, I haven’t see it.  Have you?
I have’t either. At the premiere screening the sound cut out. But instead of booing, the audience member cheers and makes their own sound effects.
Well that was sure nice of them to do that, I’m sure Spielberg appreciated it!
Right, usually that would be embarrassment. That was cool of the audience. Ready Player One is another childlike adventure where virtual reality dominates.
It sounds cool, my grandkids would probably like it.  I remember when I first saw Jaws, it scared me to death!
Yeah, I know what you mean. Ready Player one takes place on an Earth where people go to VR to escape their real life problems. I can totally imagine this happening in the future.
OMG, goodness, alot of people would def get hooked on that! Do you watch alot of movies?
I don’t really though I like Disney movies. How about you?
Me too, I love Disney movies.  I read that Disney considered shutting down their animation studio after Sleeping Beauty flopped.
I didn’t even know that Sleeping Beauty was a flop! Treasure Planet was also a Disney movie and was the most expensive box office flops of all times.
I did know that Treasure Planet was a big time flop.  I can’t remember anybody that saw it saying they liked it. I read that Tom Hanks is the highest all time box office star.
Would  you see the Silence of the Lambs on Valentine’s day? That’s the day it came out in 1991. It made over $270 million in box office.
I remember seeing it, but it wasn’t on Valentine’s day!
Trojan Wars on the other hand ws a failure. It had a 15 million budget and earned only $309 in box office.
That’s pitiful!
Yes that is quite sad. Another sad thing is even though humans are destroying the earth, if earth’s history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent one minute and 17 seconds.
Awesome, I read somewhere that when the Earth was formed a day was only 5 1/2 hours.  
Wow, I can’t even get enough done in 24 hours!
Hi Turker, are you familiar with Steven Spielberg? 
Hey. Steven Spielberg is one of the most popular directors. Seen so many of his films. 
Yes you are right, have you seen E.T? if yes, did you like the movie, I know it’s an old movie.
Yes it is an old movie. I like older movies. I remember when the game for the atari came out, they literally had to mass dump the product  in a field somewhere.
Yes I heard about that, but I wonder if the atari could have been recycle, just to think about all those Items were destroyed.
Yeah. its funny that he made all these movies here for all humans to see. Here on planet earth. A 4.5 million year old rock. I wonder if aliens seen our movies? 
yes you are right, I really like all the Jurassic Parks, I have watched those movies several times.
Dude!!! Tell me about it. Its crazy that Tom hanks made so much money. Making 8,5 billion worldwide and wasnt in any of the sagas. not in star wars and not in jurassic park.
Yes Tom Hanks made a lot of money also, did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in jaws?
That is so cool how invlolved he is. I read that a movie named trojan wars costed $15,000,000 to make and only made $309. I need to find out what movie that is lol
Wow what a loss, did you know Steven Spielberg still make millions from star wars because a bet from George Lucas in 1977?
Yes I read that. I did not know that he Directed The Color Purple. Saving private ryan was one of my favorites though.
Either me I just recently saw color purple and it still a good movie like  I have seen it for the first time.
You see how big Oprah is now right? She was wonderful in that movie.
Yes she was, do you usually purchase your tickets from the box office or purchase online?
I always buy it online. I try to avoid missing out on big titles like star wars. Pick it up at the theatre.
Did you know that more than 80 percent of the earth natural forests already been destroyed?
Yeah I read that. And we continue to use our resources like we dont have a clue whats going on. If global warming hits us, think of the already 71 % water covering earth. It will be catastrophic 
Yes you are right, we can’t see it because most of the water is underneath us. 
Oooo imagine the animals in the unexplored water world we have not seen yet. 4.5 million years old and the world has animals in its oceans for quite some time now. Like the lizards. 
when the earth was first formed a day was only 5.5 hours long. It was nice chatting with you, have a good night.
Did you know that summer was considered a bad time to release a movie?
In the past it may have been. 
Yes, it was until Jaws was released. That was a scary movie back in the day.
Yeah, that was a good movie. Did you like it? 
I use to. I think I have seen it too many times now. Spielberg played the clarinet for the soundtrack.
Yeah, that is pretty interesting. Did you see the Goonies? 
I have. That is a cute movie. I love how they get the jewels at the end to pay the mortgage.
It is pretty good. I’m fairly certain Stranger Things is a rip off of it. 
I’ve never seen that movie. There are so many rip-offs these days.
It is a show on Netflix actually. The first season isn’t that bad. 
I don’t have Netflix. These days, I’m sure that sounds weird.
I don’t either. I saw it at a friends house. 
I heard that Netflix is losing a lot of money because of password sharing. Did you know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star? I would believe it.
Yeah, that could be, they are creating a lot of their own content. 
All the streaming channels seem to be doing that now.
Yeah, that is pretty cool. Do you use Roku? 
Yes, I love my ROKU.
Do you recommend getting one of them? 
I would definitely. You can also get Netflick, Hulu. I have Amazon Prime which has lots of channels.
Oh cool. Then maybe I will check that out. Are you a Tom Hanks fan? 
I truly am. I draw charcoal portraits and I have drawn a picture of him. He is an amazing actor. I also like Robin Williams. I noticed he did a lot of movies about dying.
I think he is a great actor. Well, nice chatting with you!
Nice chatting with you too.
Do you know much about the Bible?
some yes
Did you know that has sold over an estimated 5 billion copies?  Wow.
I knew it was perhaps the most sold and published book of all time
Yes. Prior to 1963 it was not uncommon for students in the US to be required to read from the bible as part of their elementary eduction!
Yes I lived in the Southern US for a while and they still use that at times
Nice.  Thomas Jefferson created his own version of the Bible.  He used a razor to cut out the supernatural parts, such as the miracles and the resurrection.
I was fascinated to hear about that.  That would mean he did not accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, but that He was only a human man.
Yes!  Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams are the only 2 US presidents that did not use a bible when they were sworn in.
Yes that would indicate to me that they were agnostics or aherents to another form of religion
Yes.  The biblical tower of Babel was likely based on a real building, the Etemenanki in modern day Iraq.
I did not now that, but it is certainly possible.  William Shakespeare wrote an incredible amount of material even though he died at 49 years old.
Yes he did!  he is regarded ad the greatest writer in the English language!
I think I read the cliff notes to one of his plays, but I could never stay interested in his works!
I read the cliff notes of some of his things in college.  He coined a lot of popular phrases that we still use today like "good riddance" and "wild goose chase".
Yes those sayings certainly seemed to have stuck into modern language
Pocahontas and Shakespeare were alive at the same time and died only a year apart.  Interesting facts.
I guess that would mean Lewis and Clark were exploring the Western United States while Shakespeare was performing plays in England!
Yes!  lol  Shakespeare invented the names Miranda, Jessica, and Olivia.  I never knew that.
Yes, true.  His works can be found in a library, which in Greek language means "book+shelf".
I love going to libraries!  I’m a heavy user of them.  It’s been fun chatting with you!
Same thing to you. Good day.
You have a good day too!
There was man who was falsely imprisoned. He used the prison library to study law and learn to free himself. That is amazing don’t you think?
That is awesome! Speaking of libraries, there are more libraries than McDonalds in the United States. Do you have a library card?
I do and that is good to hear. Also, half of adult have library cards that seems like more than I would have thought.
I know. I don’t know that a lot of my friends go to the library. The Sacramento Library has instituted a type of library that might make going to the library more interesting to many. They started a library of things, so you can check out sewing machines and other things that you don’t need to own for a long time.
That would be so useful. I wonder if other cities do that? I know that normal library collections often included DVD’s and CD’s and other things besides books.
Yes, and I have also checked out passes to various museums in my city. I’m glad some people were dedicated to starting libraries in the past as they have been so useful to me. Have you heard of UK Prime Minister William Gladstone?
I have. I heard that he started a library in 1895 with 32,000 books in it. All from his personal collection. Can you imagine?
The more amazing thing to me is how he carted all those books by wheelbarrow over 3/4 mile. He was 85!
Maybe his daughter helped him. I wonder how many were Shakespeare plays. I was reading one at the library. Did you know that Shakespear coined many of the terms we use today, including "good riddance" and "laughing stock?"
Oh, that’s interesting. I would never have thought as luck would have it, break the ice, and full circle were from Shakespeare.
I guess it makes sense that he coined so many terms since he was the world’s greatest dramatist. Plus, he wrote so much. He wrote 39 plays!
Not only did he coin terms, but he created names. The names Miranda, Olivia and Jessica were invented by Shakespeare. I didn’t know those names went so far back!
That is interesting. I wonder if these names sound different with the accent of the time. I know the accent can affect the meaning of the performance. The old accent can introduce rhymes or puns that don’t work with our modern tongue. What might Miranda sound like in Shakespeare’s voice?
That is an interesting thought. Shakespeare has been translated into every major language. I wonder how they preserve Shakespeare’s style and language in other languages.
That is a good question. It would be interesting to study that in school. I bet people use to study Shakespeare in school more than they do now. I hear that people often studied the Bible in school before 1963.
Yes, the Bible does still play a large role in our lives though. Presidents are still sworn in with them. I wonder why Teddy Roosevelt and John Quincy Adams did not use Bibles at their swearing in ceremonies.
That is true. It does play a role still. Plus it was influenced by real history. For example, the tower of Babel was probably based on a real building in what is now Iraq.
Thomas Jefferson didn’t seem to agree with all parts of the Bible. He made his own version and cut out the supernatural parts. I wonder why that was.
Interesting!. All so at least three Presidents saw the Bible differently (Jefferson, Roosevelt and Adams.) Iti is interesting to think about how the Bible changes too. For example, the apple from Adam and Eve was a translation from the 4th century.
That’s true. And different Bible canons have evolved over the century with overlapping contents but also diverging contents.
Yes. In fact, the what is seen as canonical depends on the traditions of different groups.
That is what cuases disagreement between CHristian denominations about what should be included in the canon.
Hi!  How much do you know about planets? 
Hello - I know the alternate names for Earth are gaia, tellus, and telluris.
That is awesome, I wonder why they settled on Earth.  It is the only one without a God/Goddess name.
I saw that in 1975 the Soviet Union sent a spacecraft to Venus.
Wow, maybe that is how they found out it doesnt tilt/
You can fit every other planet between Earth and the moon/
Wow, I didnt realize it was really that far away.  Does that include pluto, they can’t decide about that poor planet.
I believe it does. There is a planet that orbits four stars.
There is a planet where shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph in 2000 degree F weather.  No thanks.
That’s crazy! Manned space stations orbit Jupiter are impossible due to the intense radiation.
I would imagine.  I have heard there are pretty violent storms on Jupiter.
I’ve heard that too. Even heard you can pick up the strong storms on Earth over radios
Jupiter has a moon that could be considered a planet if it orbited the sun.
Wow that’s crazy. Do you know much about governors?
Some, I know Schwarzenegger never lived in Sacramento, he commuted daily by private jet.
That would be hard to do. It says he went 3 hours per day by private jet. Talk about a long commute.
i couldnt do that.  time is too valuable.
I agree. Did you know that Athiests cannot be governor of South Carolina.
Wow, I didnt know that.  Texas actually elected the first female governor.
That’s really good to know. The governor of Oklahoma has an Oklahoma shaped pool.
Nice chat!  Have a great day!
hello do you like dance?
I love it. Did you know Bruce Lee was a dancer too?
Yes pretty awesome he even won a cha -cha championship once
Yes, same with Tupac, he was a ballet dancer too
Yeah and he even was part of a nutcracker production, he was the mouse
Nice. Ballet dancers go through tons of shoes, 4 pairs a week
Yeah must cost a lot too. Babies are good at dancing too when they hear music
Yeah and they smile more once they hit the beat, smart
Yes super sweet. Jackson had a patent on a device that improved his dance moves
Nice. Do you like soundtracks?
Yes I do. Did you know Spielberg, when creating the soundtrack for Jaws, played the clarinet?
the Brother Where Art Thou one is 8 times certified platinum
Wow! That is impressive. Phil Collins speaks many languages and recorded the Tarzan ST in all of them.
Yes including german, spanish, italian, and french. Amazing
I know. The track title in the Batman Begins ST is named after a genius of a bat
Haha that is super creative. Do you ever read movie reviews?
I read them sometimes, I mostly rely on Rotten Tomatoes, and you?
Me too. Did you know Bay’s average rating for his movies is just 38% there?
Wow that low? Movies based on video games also have a low rating there too
Yeah it seems. It is owned by Warner Bros
Yeah they seem to have their hand on everything
Are you a fan of dance? 
Sure. I find the movement very aesthetically pleasing.
They say that babies spontaneously dance to music. I suppose that shows there’s something very fundamentally human in dance.
Not just human! Parrots are able to dance perfectly to music. They speculate it’s tied into their ability to mimic.
Wow, I guess everything with a heartbeat probably feels some impulse to dance. More advanced forms of dance have aesthetic and symbolic value. 
Did you know Emilia Clarke did the funky chicken and robot dance to audition for Game of Thrones?
LOL, no. Can’t imagine how that would help her get the part? I do know that Bruce Lee once won a cha-cha competition in Hong Kong.
That’s pretty funny. Apparently, Mr. Rogers learned to breakdance on an episode.
And rapper Tupac Shakur danced in the Nutcracker in high school. Sounds like he and Mr Rogers swapped paths along the way.
Haha. Like Bill Bailey, an old tap dancer and Michael Jackson! Bill Bailey was first recorded moonwalking in 1955.
So someone was moonwalking for anyone (literally) moon walked? 
Ha! That’s a funny way to put it. I wonder what the called it back then? Maybe if he had been wearing those ballet slippers that make drawings from the movements we could come up with a better name.
I hear they go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Lots of wear.
Soundtracks are important in dance, as well as movies, too.
Yep. And some become bigger hits than the movies, such as the soundtrack to "O, Brother, Where Art Thou?". It went octuple platinum.
Alicia Keys wrote a song for the Men in Black soundtrack when she was only 16!
That’s impressive, although I haven’t heard the tune. I know that Channing Tatum got his start dancing in Step Up when he was young. Met his wife that way.
Yeah, it’s too bad about their divorce.
It appears to have been amicable, which is nice. They still describe each other as best friends.
Step Up had a really fun soundtrack.
But I think the critics hated it. I think it has 19% approval at Rotten Tomatoes.
Rotten Tomatoes has some pretty high standards, though. Neither Ashton Kutcher or Jennifer Love Hewitt have been in movies with a "Fresh" rating.
Good evening!  Do you know much about Maryland’s governor?
Not too much,  so you?  Did you know that ralph lawrence carr was the only governor to oppose the internement of japanese americans during ww2?
I didn’t know that.  Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, is a republican who was under some hot water for policies on climate change.
Thats interesting.  the beatles song"come together" was written for 1969 governor campaign.
Larry Hogan could probably have used the support of a group like the Beatles, but I’m sure he will be ok.  At least he isn’t as bad as North Dakota’s in 1934 who actually seceded from the US for a short time!
when schwarzenegger became governor of ca he commuted 3 hours everyday lol 
Maybe so he could leave the office every day and say "I’ll be back!"  
haha good one!   
Did you hear that Texas had a female governor before other states even allowed women to vote?
Yeah thats really interesting. did you know there hasnt been a us president who wasnt a rep or dem since 1853?
Wow!  We truly are a two party system, but don’t try getting elected as president as a democrat with a beard.  So far all bearded presidents have been republican.
Im not excited about that,  I will never be president lol 
It’s crazy to think that red/blue connotations for the parties isn’t even 20 years old.  
Yeah it seems like that was always the case,  but I guess not.  
The Bush’s had a heck of a run with three terms.  In fact, before Trump, you’d have to go back to 1928 to find an elected republican that didn’t have nixon or a bush.
Thats interesting,  do you know much about our planets?  The planet uranus rotates sideways instead of spinning. 
Crazy!  Jupiter is so big that it has moons that would be planets if they simply orbited the sun and Jupiter.
That is cool.  there is a planet that shards of glass rain sideways at 4500 mph!!!  thats insane!
Wow.  There are some crazy planets out there.  Venus doesn’t even have seasons because it doesn’t tilt and rotates in a different direction than the rest of the planets that revolve around our sun.
That is really interesting. I heard that astronauts can vote from space, lol. 
Must have been an absentee ballot!  
It’s been fun chatting,  have a good one. 
Have you ever used the Rotten Tomatoes website? I check out all the movies I’m going to watch on there first.
You know, I do to.  I feel it’s better to be informed than waste my time or money without knowing.
If I’m watching a movie at home I don’t care about the reviews as much but definitely want to make sure I am getting my moneys worth at the theater.
Amen, to that.  Movie ticket prices are outrageous, nowadays.  Netflix has almost 150 movies that carry a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating.
I’ve found it has been so hard to find a movie on Netflix, I have been watching a lot of their original content lately though. Do you watch Netflix?
All the time.  It is another one of those companies created by college students.  Lol.  All I did in college was party!
Yeah I didn’t spend my time in college trying to make companies either, I wish I did though.
Just a random note, did you realize that Bruce Lee wa such a good dancer?
I did not, but with his athleticism and talent I am not surprised.
I know right!  He won the 1958 Cha Cha championship in Hong Kong.  I can not even picture that.
I would like to see some video of that. I have only seen a couple of his movies.
Speaking of dancing, are you aware that Michael Jackson holds a patent on a dance device?
I did not know that but if anyone would have one it’s him.
That’s right, he was a master of dance.  This device apparently, helped him get that extreme lean that he did in some of his dances.
Now that you mention it I do somewhat remember seeing how he did that. It was almost like a piece of metal that would lock into his shoe so he could almost lean 45 degrees. I believe he used it in the Smooth Criminal music video.
Looked very cool, when he did it!  I heard somewhere that Tupac danced ballet.  Have you heard anything about that?
I had heard he trained in the ballet. Did you know that the Air Jordan logo is him doing a ballet move?
Wow, I didn’t know that!
A lot of athletes have used ballet and now yoga to help with flexibility and reduce injuries!
Yes, I hear it does help tremendously.
I have taken yoga before but I need a few more classes before I get more flexible. It was fun chatting with you, have a great day!
hello
Hello, Michael jackson has a patent. on a device used to achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves
That is extremely interesting actually. never knew that
I didn’t either.  I guess for the song Smooth Criminal.
perhaps. what article you thought was the most interesting?
Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker.
I found interesting the concept with rotten tomatoes. Poor people
Babies spontaneously dance when they hear music, and smile more when they hit the beat.  Dance is so interesting. 
Dance truly is interesting. As for the babies dancing spontaneously when they hear music, I totally agree. My child does the same
Mine do as well.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.
That I certainly didn’t know. She is still too little for ballet lol
Michael bay’s average rotten tomatoes film rating is 38%
Quite surprising. Also Netflix has almost 150 movies with 100% rating on rotten tomatoes
I was just reading that.  How cool is that? I like to watch some of the stuff on Netflix.
I also like to watch movies on Netflix. Its convenient and the premium is not too high
Exactly, Spykids received a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, better than, say, lincoln or the dark knight rises.
true that. How about soundtracks. Any thoughts on that?
I didn’t realize that Steven spielberg played the clarinet in the jaws soundtrack.
Same here. Thought it was very interesting
No doubt.  The soundtrack to ’o brother, where art thou?’ is certified 8 times platinum.
yep.pretty fascinating
Thanks for the chat.  It was informative.
same. have a good day
Thanks, you too.
bye
How do you like planet earth?
I find the earth and the solar system very interesting!
It is so interesting! I love learning about planets. Like Jupiters mon Ganymede!
Yes, I agree! Isn’t the Ganymede Jupiters own moon?
yea, it would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun, that is amazing
Very, Did you know our planet Earth has other names besides Gaia?
I didn’t know there were any names besides Earth, lol. I guess maybe the blue planet, what other names do you know?
Tellus and Telluris!  very cool! This is also a planet that orbits four stars!
wow! I love learning! I think I saw once that astronomers found a planet many light years away that could sustain life
Yes, I heard that too! Exciting!! Do you know anything about the solar asteroid belt?
I do not know too much, i just know there is crazy things that happen out there, how about you?
True,  its has celestial bodies called Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta!
I need to tough up on my planet facts, you have so many! I know that five planets are visual with the naked eye in the sky
Yes, Aren’t they interesting! Do you have a favorite planet? I think mine would be Jupiter and Venus!!
Mine is mars, I hope we get a man on mars in my lifetime, do you think it will happen/
Oh yes, Mars!! I love it too!! I hope so, There is a good chance we will. 
I bet, the more money we spend the better our chances. We just need some brave souls that are willing to take the chance like the first time we went to space!
Yes, very brave!! I hope we can do that sometime soon. Are there signs of water on Mars?
I think there have been theories of underground lakes and the potential of water. I will read up on it more. It was so nice chatting with you and getting good facts!
Really, I thought there was or at least they thought so!! Yes, enjoyed chatting too!
Have a great night!
Hi.  I guess Channig Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are getting a divorce.  Sad.
Yes, I read about that in the news. The things he says about it almost sound too good to be true...maybe it’s sarcastic?
Not sure... They were a good team.  I guess "Step Up" was a favorite for many.
Seems like it. I never saw it, though.They are pretty talented to be good at both acting and dancing. Singing, too?
I think so, the "Step Up" soundtrack had high acclaim. 
I think the movie tried to have an overall good message to be the best you can be in everything you do. Inspirational for many.
That’s refreshing... I can see why ABC Family was mentioned. 
Kids love to dance to soundtracks, too. I think they even have a few video games with dance and music
Yes, they do.  I didn’t know Bruce Lee was also a great dancer.  I thought he just beat up bad guys. 
That’s really cool! I think Patrick Swayze was also a multi-talented actor dancer. He was in a very famous movie and that soundtrack is also great.
I can see him but Tupac?  I guess Tupac danced ballet in high school.  How can you hide a gun in tights? 
That sounds so crazy it might even be an urban legend! Ballet dancers go through a lot of shoes in just one week. Think how their feet feel!
Ouch!  I guess we are all dancers to some degree.  Babies naturally dance when they hear music.
I remember as kids we’d have birthday parties and dance to various Disney Soundtracks. Do they still make those, I wonder?
If they do, they are probably "R" rated.  Disney has changed for the worse.  I think it’s great the Spielberg played clarinet in the Jaws soundtrack.
Speilberg is amazing! It wouldn’t surprise me if he could dance well, too! I wonder if he’d ever play an instrument in another soundtrack?
Don’t know... I do know that Phil Collins recorded the Tarzan sound track in many different languages. Ilaian, German, etc. 
That’s amazing! I wonder if those are all rated on Rotten Tomatoes? It’s owned by WB so I wonder if it’s hard on Disney or other rivals?
I wonder if that biases their judgement for WB productions.  No film based on video games ever got a rating above 44% from RT.
If you like video games, some of those movies are pretty good, too. I didn’t realize Rotten Tomatoes was started by students until recently! Brilliant!, 
I kind of look at IMDB for ratings... Great chat! You were excellent!
Hey do you like Star Wars? I know that I like the first three movies, the next three are ok, and I really hate the new ones
I love the original 3 like you. But the new ones are bad, I agree. 
Haha well I’m glad we agree on that. What did you think about Rogue one that came out in 2016? I thought it was a total disaster haha
I think any movie that relegates the Great Luke to the trash heap is nothing. "No! I am your Father" is the greatest scene of all time.
Oh I agree with you. I just feel bad that James Earl Jones only made about eight grand for doing the voice in the first movie, although it was only about two and a half hours of work, he hit it out of the park
Really? That is bad. Have you ever scene the scenes without him and the original actor? 
Yes I have. Doesn’t that guy have a Scottish accent or something? And I think he thought he was going to be the actual voice, very strange.
Hilarious. I think they are great though. I didn’t know JEJ only spent 2.5 hours recording though!
Yeah I know, he did a great job for the limited time, can you believe that 20th Century Fox let George Lucas keep the merchandising rights, that’s what made him a billionaire, so crazy I don’t think they would do that ever again
I think I can believe it. Good for him, what does the corporation need with something they didn’t invent anyways?
No I agree with you. Are you going to watch the Academy Awards by the way? They give out 24 Awards and I think that the first broadcast was back in 1930, which is wild
Yeah, so like the academy awards totally suck. Does anyone actually give a bleep what they think?
No I think that they don’t really pick the best movies. A lot of good movies that I like a lot or never even nominated. I do like Daniel Day-Lewis though, I’m glad that he won three times for best actor
By the way, do you watch you tube? Much better than AA!
Yes I agree with you! I watch YouTube almost everyday. I can’t believe that Google bought YouTube for 1.65 billion dollars back in 2006. That seems like so long ago
Oh, I can believe it. Google could make it a success, Youtube couldn’t succeed on it own. 
Yep I agree with you. Did you know that YouTube is the second biggest search engine, I assume that Google is the first
I’m surprised it isn’t the first to be honest! 
Yeah I know that everyone uses YouTube do you ever watch the music video for Gangnam Style by the way. That is one of the highest viewed videos on youtube
No, but I have watched it. Good song, good short term fad too!
Yep it was definitely a fad haha. So was Justin Bieber song Baby, I don’t think it should be the most disliked video on YouTube, but it’s definitely annoying
Hello there, so have you seen any of the Star Wars movies?
I have seen several. I read Tran who played rose left Instagram after racist messages from fans.
That is so sad fans are so cruel to people.  I have yet to see her in that movie, I really want to though. 
Me too. The last Jedi divided it’s fans
Yeah I think each movie does because there are so many of them and they all have their different tastes.  But the personal comments to the actors is just stupid. 
Did you know Chloe Bennet changed her last name to get in to US easier
No I didn’t know that, I wonder how many people do that when they come here.  
Seems like a lot. Apparently they get more call backs with American last names.
Yeah I can see that, and whatever helps for them I’m sure they will do.  Hey do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid for doing all the darth vader lines? 
No. What is it?
I guess he only got paid $7,500, but when I say only, it only took him two and a half hours to do them!
That’s a lot for 2 and half hours.in 2018 star wars was worth $65 billion
Holy cow, I wonder how much it was worth in 1998, probably less than half of that. 
In 2013 star wars was dubbed in Navajo, making it the first major film to be in navajo
That is awesome!  Did you know Star Wars holds a Guinness World Record title?
No for what? Fox thought star wars would flop
I guess they hold the record for most successful film merchandising franchise.  When I hear merchandising I think of that scene from Spaceballs. 
Do you watch the academy awards? Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio
That is crazy!  I heard he has more than Johnny Depp and Will Smith as well. 
The Oscars were nominated for 9 Emmys in 2013.
What? That is so stupid to me, why an awards show?  Do you know who is the only actor to win best actor 3 times?
Daniel day Lewis I think.
Good call!  He is a great actor though so I can see it, I wonder what roles he won for.  Maybe the butcher role in Gangs of New York. 
Probably. Blazing saddles was nomonanom for 3 Oscars too. Well have a great night.
Hello, do you like Star Wars?
I don’t really though I do respect it as a franchise. How about you?
Yeah I like it. Lucas’ wife made such changes to the script that she won the Academy Award
Star Wars is the second highest grossing film series of all time. It’s spawned into a bunch of other media like books, video games, theme parks.
Yeah it has certainly taken over everything. It was even dubbed in Navajo
Cool! James Cameron decided to quit being a truck driver so that he could enter the film industry after watching Star Wars. I guess that was the right decision.
Oh for sure it was, the guy is a legend now. James Earl Jones got only $7500 recording Darth Vader’s lines
Crazy! Fox thought Star Wars was going to flop and agreed to George Lucas’s proposition to forgo an extra $500K directing fee so that he could keep licensing and merchandising rights. Their decision cost them billions of dollars
Yeah and at the same time made Lucas a billionaire. He just had a lot of confidence in his work
Yeah, in 2018 the whole Star Wars franchise was estimated at $65 billion
That is insane. Do you watch the Academy Awards?
No, I don’t. How about you?
I watch it sometimes. Did you know Daniel Day-Lewis has won the Oscar 3 times?
I am not sure I even know who he is. Good for him. John Williams has been nominated for more Oscars than anyone besides Walt Disney.
Yeah Disney is going to be hard to reach by anyone else with 22 Oscars
He got a special Oscar in 1938 for snow white that had a regular sized statuette and seven miniature oscars. 
That is amazing. Eminem has more Oscars than Leonardo DiCaprio and some other big names. 
Speaking of Oscars, Kelly Marie Tran went to them. She is the first non white woman in Star Wars leading role.
That is amazing. Have you seen the movie Blazing Saddles?
I have not seen it. Tran faced a lot of racist and abusive language on her social media though. That’s sad.
That is just sad. I hope we move towards behaving as we should with each other. Nice chat :)
Hi there!  Are you a Star Wars fan?
Hi, Yes I am a star wars fan!!! Since I was a kid. What about you?
Yes!  Mostly when it comes to the Original trilogy.  Those are the best.
It is amazing how star wars was created long time ago , in 1977 and with a movie made last year , the star wars fever is so alive!
It has to be one of the most sucessful franchises ever.  40 years and still has a great following.
It is incredible that the first eight films were nominated for academy awards, they were able to  create wonderful productions!
The total value of the franchise was about $65 billion.  It will definitely always be a legend!
And 20 century fox though star wars was going to be a failure!!
I heard that, apparently so did Harrison Ford, I heard he didnt want to be credited in the film initially.
Is that right! Well, good for George Lucas because this poor vision from 20 century made him a billionaire
It definitely did.  Do you know how much James Earl Jones was paid to record Darth Vader’s lines?
I believe it was $7,500, and he just spent 2 hours and a half doing so
Isnt that crazy?  Some of those lines are so iconic, and he got so little for them.  Shame.
I agree, it is basically nothing.. Did you know George Luca’s wife influenced the star wars movies a lot?
Yeah, didnt she receive an editing award too?
She got an award for editing!! I think she made an important contribution.. good job
She definitely changed some parts significantly.  It would have been far different without her.
Yes, she did major changes.. and is interesting George did not get the award for directing!
Eminem has more oscars than George Lucas!  That is hard to believe!
Wow, and he has won more awards than Leo Di Caprio, Johnny Depp and Bill murray combined
I didnt realized he had any at all, I wonder what they were all for.
Have to check!! Do you know who has won , best actor 3 times?
Who?  Harrison Ford?
It is Daniel Day Lewis, what an accomplishment
It really is!  It has been great chatting, but I must go.  have a great night!
You do the same!!
Government is fascinating. It seems so different the world over yet there are common threads in every type. 
I agree. Some governments try to help, others, not so much.
So true. I wonder what america would look like if we had a PM instead of a president. A PM seems to be held more accountable for their actions. 
True. Much easier to remove. Australia’s PM position isn’t in the constitution and exists only through custom. That seems strange to me. Not in the Constitution?
Australia’s constitution is weird though. It doesn’t protect the people as much like an american one does. 
I did not know that. Number 10 Downing Street has a cat with a title! I wonder how many other government headquarters have animals like that.
With all the historic buildings in the UK I could see why they need one. Older structures like that tend to attract rodents. 
Is one cat enough though? Might need a support staff.
Right? lol. I wonder if you can meet the cat if you tour the offices?
The cat doesn’t take visitors without an appointment.
I could see the cat being involved in a lot of the pranks the UK officials seem to play on each other. 
When you turn 100 in japan, the PM gives you a silver cup to celebrate. Too many people are turning 100 so that they had to find a way to make cheaper cups. Maybe give the cup when people turn 200?
That would be one way to cut the costs. How many people are turning 100 that it is costing enough to have to find a cheaper solution? Talk about a healthy society. 
Yeah. Celebrating a centennial is cool, but the gov’t can’t afford it! Are you a fan of Johnny Depp?
I find him very interesting. He is one of those chameleon actors that you never watch and go Oh that’s Johnny Depp he sort of absorbs the character. 
Johnny  is producing and maybe starring in a biopic about  Dr. Seuss. I would be interested in that.
I think he would make a fantastic Dr. Seuss Look what an amazing job he did with willy wonka. I think the creepy edge he gave to the character was perfect. 
He is really dedicated to his craft. Edward Scissorhands was an odd film, but he made it work.
That whole movie was just weird. He might be a strange man but he seems to really have a good heart. 
I know that he often visits children in the hospital dressed up as a pirate.
He seems to really be an animal lover too. 
Many people like to watch horror films, I don’t like slashers but like some like World War Z, did you know the horror film genre has been around for more than a century?
oh yes, I even watched the first "Nosferatu" movie - not sure when that was made but it’s quite old...
That one is a  classic, based on the book by Bram Stoker.  They say if you watch a horror movie you will enjoy abstract art more, maybe because they are both a horror?
I always loved horror movies... they work good on Your imagination ;)
They are good for your health as well, guess why?
Horrors good for Your health ? You poop more often ? I don’t know ;)
Ha, that or have a heart attack, no seriously, you burn 180 calories watching a horror movie, wonder what other types of cinema burn?
I mean if the movie really scares You, than maybe, but what if You just like the story, but it’s no longer scary for You, because You’ve seen it all ? ;)
I can’t imagine not being scared watching a horror movie, thats why I like other forms of cinema.  Do you know cinematogrrpahy is the science of motion picture photography and important to all types of movies?
well sure, it’s just hundreds of pictures with sound in the background ;)
The art is making them look good with the right music and sound to tell a story.  Do youknow the guy who pioneered the use of the wide angle lens won aan oscar but was not a citizen until ’43 and illegally married a white woman because he was Chinese American, we have done some stupid things in our past treatment of others.
I mean I wouldn’t say it’s stupid... if he was here illegally, that means he broke the law... there was no legal way to get here ?
He was her and became a citizen, the law he broke was marrying a white woman because he was asian. That is crazy.
ahhh, I did not get that. So he came it legally ? and he couldn’t marry white woman ? Was that a law ? What year was that ??
His marriage did not become legal until 1948, prior to that it was considered illegal.  No woman has every been nominated for best cinematography Oscars either, so I guess there are still some issues.
There will always be issues with race... but we’re getting there...
I like the fantasy escape from all of our problems we find at the box office.  I guess others do to since Tom Hanks has made over 8.5 billion.
I mean good for him, he was always very talented, but honestly, I don’t remember seeing any new movie with him, do You ?
I haven’t seen anything new in a long time,  I did love Forest Gump, and You’ve got Mail though.  I really like Disney movies, do you know Sleeping Beauty was such a failure they considered closing down.
lol, no I didn’t know that. I have a beef with Disney thou... I loved it when I was a kid, but since they’ve destroyed Star Wars... they’re dead to me ;)
I prefer the original 3 from my childhood in the 70’s.  Hopefully they learn something from their flops like Treasure planet, not that was a waste of money.
yes. just because its Disney and it has to be ok for kids ? make a division for adults and start making decent movies... You have the budget, technicians... nothing would stop them...
I think they have a separate division but can’t remember what it is called.  I’m not sure I’d like to see the name Disney on a film like Silence of the Lambs though.
Why not... it was a great movie. Classic. but I see what You ’re saying. No I mean make movies like Star Wars for a little bit mature audience... don’t focus on 6year olds because there are millions of 60 year old wanted to see how the story continues...
We never get to see the rebuilding of the galaxy and having Leia and Han’s son kill Han and be bad was a stupid thing to do.
it was a poor choice yes. and the way they showed Luke was not to my liking either...
They made him seem like he regressed into some kind of whiney baby, at his age and experience he should be evolving more like Ben Kenobi or even Yoda, not woah is me I need a xanex Luke
That’s my point exactly ! He was Vader’s son ! Son of a person born out of force.. in my mind, he should be leading everybody to defeat Siths OR maybe share the faith of his father and go the the dark side... but not this...
It was so frustrating and annoying.  Vader’s turn to the bright side at the end should have affirmed him and gave him deterination to continue, and why have Han’s son be so bad, that is just pointless,  I guess they couldn’t think of a bad guy.
I think they are preparing a twist of action nobody is suspecting but I think it’s in a bad taste. I personally think Han Solo lives ;)
I won’t even pay to see the rest of them,  the cinematography is great though.
Absolutely ;) no argument here ;)
If I was a better cinematographer, I’d make my own movies, but thats not in the cards.  Its been nice visiting with you.
Same here, thank You so much for fun conversation ! ;)
Hey there what do you know about the prime minister of the UK?
I don’t know that much actually. He has a cat though. 
I love the name of the cat. The name is Chief Mouser of the cabinet office LOL can’t say I like cats though haha
Hilarious. What happens if someone is allergic? 
I am actually allergic to cats. And that’s a great question haha do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is?
yeah, she was in Fight Club, other than that I don’t remember many of the movies with her. 
Apparently she’s related to the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War I. That’s very bizarre
Really? That is pretty weird. Did you know if you hit 100 in japan they give you a silver cup? 
I did not know that. It’s funny that so many people turned 100 they had to find a way to make cheaper cups though haha
Hilarious, at least they are healthy there. 
That’s true they’re definitely not giving those Awards away in the United States haha. I do like that Norway donated a billion dollars to save the Amazon rainforest though that’s very nice of them
Yeah, that seems interesting, do they do a lot of business there? 
I’m not sure actually. They might have just donated it because they’re nice. Unlike The guy who sold the Eiffel Tower twice who definitely just wanted the money haha
That’s hilarious, he wasn’t even the owner. Did you know Johnny Depp directed the film brave? 
Oh I didn’t know that. Have you seen that movie is it any good?
I haven’t actually. LOL BTW, apparently 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US Government. 
Wow that is a lot. Very strange that Johnny Depp is making a movie about dr suess. But I think he would be great for the role
I think that may have already have been released, but maybe I am wrong. 
It does sound familiar. Have you seen the movie Edward Scissorhands? Apparently Johnny Depp only says about 200 words
It’s been a very long time, but yeah I saw it. Now that I think about it, he barely speaks in that film! 
You’re right. I do love that movie a lot though. It’s a great winter movie. Johnny Depp seems like a nice guy. He adopted his one-eyed horse from the movie Sleepy Hollow when he heard it was going to be put down
hi, do you like johnny depp?
Hi, how are you? Who is Johnny Depp? A singer? An athlete?
He is an actor. He is the one that directed the movie The Brave, if you have seen it
I have not seen it. Is it about brave people or an Indian brave? Is he an American Indian?
I think he might be partly american indigenous. I am not sure though.
Is he pretty ethnic? I think he’d have to be pretty ethnic to pull that off. Not like Elvis. Was Johnny a friend of Nic Cage?
He might be I am not sure. He even adopted the one eyed horse that was in the movie saleepy hollow
A one-eyed horse? That sounds odd. What is so charming about Cyclops the Horse? I guess you would have to put an eyepatch over one of the eyes.
They were going to put the horse down so he wanted to save it
I guess he had a place for keeping horses. Do you know much about government? I am not a fan of government. It seems like a useful invention, much like a one-eyed horse.
Me either but I do find it strange that the govnerment owns 86% of the land in Nevada
I figure the gov’t must be up to something in that Nevada desert. War games? Alien spaceports?
I have no idea they are certainly using it for something. Did you ever play nintendo?
I played a bit. I warn’t into them games. I had other chores to attend to on the farm/prison where I growed up. You? Did you play them games?
Sounds rough. Do you know about wikileaks?
I applied for a job there, but they didn’t hire me. Said my background wasn’t suspicious enough. 
Hahhaha that is funny. did you know they figured out the government is trying to destroy them
Well, they are Wikileaks, so they have a list of enemies pretty long. 
Yes that makes sense. Did you know a man in france sold the eiffer tower twice?
That man could probably sell the govt’s land in Nevada for us! Well, I’ve had a swell time chatting!
Same here, have a good one.
Hi! Did you know the Prime Minister of Australia’s position isn’t actually in their constitution but only exists through custom? I find that surprising!
Wow I didn’t know that. I also didn’t know that the Prime Minister selects and then can dismiss members of the cabinet. I always wondered what they did
It’s a little strange, isn’t it? But on a lighter note, a radio station prank called Queen Elizabeth II back in 95, pretending to be Jean Chretien who was the Prime Minister of Canada back then. Ha!
That is very strange. Do you know who Helena Bonham Carter is? She was in the Harry Potter movies, but anyway she is the great-granddaughter of a prime minister
Is that so? I wonder if she used her family to become an actress? Ha! Well in Japan, their Prime Minister sends their residents a silver cup when they turn 100 to celebrate it. Problem is, so many are turning 100 now, they’re having to find ways to make cheaper cups. That’s a good thing though!
That is a good thing! What do you think about Wikileaks by the way? Apparently the government try to destroy them, but Wikileaks just leaked their plans LOL
That’s kind of ironic, isn’t it? I wonder if Wikileaks will tell us what the government does with the 86% of Nevada’s land that they own?
That is a good question. Maybe it is Area 51 that they own haha? It’s also crazy to think that Norway donated a billion dollars to help save the rainforest, I wonder if they own the land or just donated it
That’s a good question. I’m glad they’re taking action to protect the rainforests though! Did you ever hear about the guy in France who posed as a government official and sold the Eiffel Tower twice? It’s like how did he pull that off? Someone like him could sell fire in hell! Ha!
Haha yes a very talented salesman for sure! Definitely a scam too. What do you think about the actor Johnny Depp by the way? He likes to live in France
Does he really? I think he’s a great actor. Although I’m not sure about his directing skills as I still haven’t seen The Brave that he directed back in 1997!
No I’ve never even heard of that movie. I do know that gives a good actor, I loved him in Edward Scissorhands even though he only said 196 words
That is weird to have so few lines like that! I can’t believe Gene Wilder didn’t watch the Willy Wonka remake because he didn’t want to be disappointed in Depp. That is a little disappointing to me.
Yes that is disappointing. I hope that Johnny Depp goes through with making a biopic about dr. Seuss. That would actually be my first choice for a person to play him
Agreed. That would be cool to see. I mean, I think that film would earn him another academy award nomination. I mean, He’s already been nominated for three!
Yes that is impressive! He seems like a nice guy, he adopted a one-eyed horse in one of his movies because they were going to put it down, that’s nice thing to do
That’s a very nice and humane thing to do! He’s certainly come a long way since his rise in the 1980s with 21 Jump Street, hasn’t he?
Yes absolutely! It’s crazy that he was born in 1963, I remember when he was just a young man
Absolutely! Back when he was just becoming a teen idol before going on to win Best Actor at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actor’s Guild Awards!
Yes absolutely! I never knew that he was actually named John Christopher Depp II though. I wonder if his dad was also an actor?
I wonder that as well now that you mention it! Hey, maybe one day he’ll run for a position in the government! Ha! I’m sure he’s wise enough to know each government has a constitution in place which as you know is a statement of its philosophies and principles! Well it was great chatting with you! Have a good evening, friend!
How’s it going, do you watch Horror films? The first ones were inspired by Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley
I love horror movies, I am a stephen king fan!
It’s kinda strange Stephen King considers bambi a horror movie
Right, it must have made him so scared as a kid. I think about the shining sometimes, good movie. The boy in the movie didnt know it was a horror movie until years later
I’m surprised the boy from the shinning couldn’t figure out he was in a horror movie from the scenes with the bloody elevator and creepy twins
right, or the guy breaking down the door. I wonder how the movie was at the box office
Probably pretty scary, apparently you can burn more than 180 calories watching a horror movie
Dang I need to watch like 10 per night for my diet since I don’t do anything else lol
Watching horror movies also makes viewing abstract art more enjoyable too
I wonder how that works, do you know the science behind it?
I have no clue, probably something to do with psychology that makes abstract art more enjoyable after a horror movie
I bet. You know what else is scary, Treasure Island by disney only made 309 dollars on a 15000000 dollar budget!
Yea, that is pretty horrible. Treasure Planet by Disney was also a huge box office flop
sorry I meant treasure planet lol. Silence of the lambs came out on valentines day, imagine that date? lol
Well it couldn’t of been that bad since Silence of the lambs made 270 million at the box office
for sure, I mean bringing your date to it! Almost as crazy as disney almost shutting down their studios because of sleeping beauty failing
That is crazy. Do you like Tom Hanks, he’s grossed over 8.5 billion at the box office
Man, he should be in every movie at that much money! Youre guaranteed to make money at that rate i think
Yea, Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office draw
That is amazing, great actor! good chatting with you!
Have a good one
Good Morning! Do you like to watch horror films?
Hi, how are you? I am not really a fan of the genre, though I have some favorites.
What are some of your favorite ones? Stephen king considers Bambi one haha.
King was just a kid, to be fair. That movie could be scary to a tiny child. He then turned his fright into a profession.
You’re right on that one. Did you know you can burn 180 calories watching one?
I suppose that I could try to lose weight that way. It might be easier to exercise. I like a couple of films, but after the first viewing, they are not as scary.
Just do a marathon one day of watching them and you’ll be set. Have you seen the Shining? The boy actor didn’t even know it was a horror film until years later.
I liked the Shining. King wrote a great story and it translated well to the screen. I am surprised by the kid though. What did he think it was?
That is a good question. You would think watching the cinematography alone would let you know it was one!
I wonder if he ever saw the film while he was a kid. I think maybe his parents wouldn’t let him. 
That could be it! Did you know no woman has ever been nominated for best cinematography at the oscars?
That is a shame. I don’t know how many women cinematographers there are, but probably not enough. There should be more.
I agree with you! Especially with the box office at what it is. I would hate to work for the movie Trojan Wars. They made only 309 dollars on a budget of 15 million!
Movies are such a crapshoot. There is no magic formula for success. Stars, special FX, marketing. Doesn’t matter.
They really are, even with the big names. Tom Hanks has earned 8.5 billion in film earnings for his movies.
He is a bankable star. People love him. But he also works with certain people regularly. Spielberg. Zemeckis. They are capable directors.
Oh for sure! Have you seen Disney’s Treasure Planet? That was one of the most expensive box office flops ever.
I did not. Was that animated? Usually animated stuff is pretty good. I’m surprised.
I am surprised too, especially with the Disney name attached to it!
I guess a lot depends on the director. I don’t know who directed Treasure Planet.
I am going to google that now. Have a good day!
Are you a soccer or tennis fan?
Well I personally prefer tennis, but I also like lacrosse, did you hear about the spring all met boys lacrosse team?
No, what was that?
Well they want a lot of Awards this year, and I think they’re going to do even better next year
I will have to follow them. Tennis is fun too. a black man won the us open in 1968 and no other black man has since then. That would be award worthy
Yes they should make a movie about him! it’s interesting to that until 1978 you could use any object as a tennis racket, that sounds dangerous
That would be hilarious to see what some  people came up with. What would  you use? lol
I would use a rocket launcher LOL just kidding. do you watch soccer at all? Apparently soccer makes more than all other sports combined
Lol that would be perfect, no opponent means you  win everytime! 
That’s a great point! Did you know that table tennis is the name of the actual sport, and that ping pong is only the name of the company that sells the table tennis equipment?
I did not know that, wow! Mind blown! Back to soccer, did you have a favorite team in the world cup?
No I don’t. I really don’t like soccer I think it’s boring LOL it’s weird to me that the Super Bowl is smaller than soccer’s biggest events
it is boring, but it is kind of fun to watch one week per 4 years lol. I liked Brazil
Well soccer is a good exercise though, apparently a player will run about 7 miles per game, that’s good for burning calories
so good, they always have tight bodies lol. There was a german soccer player who donated 300000 euros to help pay for surgeries in brazil
That’s really nice of him! What a nice guy, why do you think Greenland can’t join FIFA? Apparently it’s because they can’t grow green grass LOL
lol, that is a valid point but don’t you think they could use turf? That is a little wrong i think 
Yep I agree it seems stupid. I don’t know why they need to play on grass specifically, did you hear about the longest tennis point of all time?
I didn’t what was that?
I was asking about the longest point in pro tennis, apparently it lasted for 29 minute straight, it was a 600 shot rally, that’s incredible
Wow, great chatting with you!
Hello
Hi. Do you play tennis?
I used to and love it.  Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene "the crocodile" lacoste and only later adopted by polo players
I once watched a match where single point lasted nearly 30 minutes. It was historic
Wow, They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 us open
I remember when players could use just about everything for a racket except the kitchen sink
Haha, The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.
Do you know who played in that match?
No, I sure don’t.  I bet they were worn out though.
Tennis players make quite a bit of money if they win a tournament but not as much as soccer players
Yes, they do.  On another note, did you know that the rapper drake graduated high school on october 2012 at the age of 25
That is a little late isn’t it or do Canadians graduate at a later age?
Haha, that is very late.  Probably a ssllooww learner.  The beat of drake’s song "hotline bling" is actually sampled from timmy thomas’ 1972 hit "why we can’t live together".
I absolutely love his music!
During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an Obscene amount of money’’ on first editions of children’s classic books  Charlotte’s web’ and  Winnie the pooh’.
I wonder why he would do that. He doesn’t seem like he is into reading seeing as though he graduated high school so late
Good question.  After hearing eminem’s verse on drake’s song forever, kanye west took two days and cancelled appointments to rewrite his.
Didn’t Drake do some acting when he was younger?
Yes.  Drake initially gained recognition as an actor on the teen drama television series Degrassi: The Next Generation in the early 2000s.
They named a college after him too, didn’t they?
I’m not sure about that.
I’m gonna go listen to his album on YouTube now. 
Hello,  how are you doing? Soccer makes more money than football, basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and hockey combined.
Hello, I’m doing great. Have you ever watched the variation that has three teams, instead of two?
Nope.  Did you know Jon stewart was a skilled soccer player in college and represented the us at the pan american maccabi games in brazil in 1983.
I do not follow soccer, I do remember reading about the German player who donated his bonus so 23 kids could have surgery.
Wow so generous!  thats amazing! Americans call it "soccer" because it was slang for association football
I find it fascinating that they used to dry the tennis couts for the 69’ US Open with helicopters. I would have loved to see that.
Seems like a huge expense lol
I didn’t know the rapper Drake, was Canadian, did you?
Yes. During a uk tour in 2011, drake spent an "obscene amount of money’’ on first editions of children’s classic books ’charlotte’s web’ and ’winnie the pooh’.
That’s sweet, and it’s interesting that he chose to graduate at 25, instead of getting his GED.
Yeah,  maybe he really liked his friends that were still in the high school. 
Kanye is so sensitive, I cannot believe that he actually cancelled appointments to rewrite his part of a song with Drake, after hearing Eminiem’s verse.
Yeah,  he definitely is sensitive. 
Did you watch the show Degrassi? He was an actor on it, I’ve never heard of it.
I’ve heard of it never watched it though.  Is that Disney?
I’m not sure, as I’ve never watched it, even though it was on for seven years.
The rapper drake visited drake university in the middle of the night after students gave up trying to get him to visit during a tour stop.
That’s funny, I bet he made their night. I was surprised to hear that he is signed with Lil’ Wayne’s label, instead of Dre’s Death Row.
Yes,  that was very interesting,  although either way he still would’ve made a lot of money
I think One Dance is my favorite by him, it’s also one of his most popular.
me too,  that song was great!  good talking to you 
Hi, do you know anything about lacrosse?
Hello there, I don’t know too much I will say, how about you
Not a ton... I love sports though so I could get into it if I needed to. Do you like any other sports?
Yeah same here, I like to be able to at least play every sport just a bit once. Do you follow tennis at all?
I do. I used to play a lot but not any more. Do you play too?
I have tried to play a few times, but that game is pretty tough.  Did you know you could use any object as a racket until 1978?  Wonder if anyone ever used anything strange. 
Probably but not in serious competitions. A tennis player actually invented the polo! Who knew!
Lol, that is pretty funny, and now they have the polo players on there, I bet the company wants people to think they invented them. 
The player was Rene "The crocodile" lacoste. His company uses the alligator and is called Lacoste still!
That is awesome, yeah I still see the alligator shirts around a bit these days.  What a cool name!
They use helicopters to dry us open tennis courts. Who knew!
I heard about that!  During a major tournament or something right?
Yeah, the US open. Seems like they should have been more prepared.
Yeah, but, to me that is pretty good improvisation for whoever came with that idea. 
Agreed. I work in recreation facilities and would not have thought of calling in a helicopter for any of my isssues.
Right same here (if i did work in that area).  Do you know what the longest rally was in tennis history?
I have no idea. How long?
It was a 643 shot rally that went on for almost 30 minutes!  That is insane, those people must have been tired after that one lol. 
I know. The longest match in history was 11 hours over 3 days! 
Holy cow, I wonder how many people that started watching that match actually finished?
I would have fallen asleep, all three days! Nice chatting with you!
Hello there. Have you ever played the guitar or piano?
no. I would have liked to play but never did. Fan of guitar players from the 60s and 70s
oh nice! That reminds me, Eddie van Halen actually set a studio speaker on fire from playing the guitar solo for Beat It, 
I have heard that. Hendrix set his guitar on fire at Woodstock.
That just shows how badass they are, haha! The best guitarists are the ones that set stuff on fire from playing... or have a phd in astrophysics like the one from Queen.
Yes. He is a smart guy.
Do you know how to play the guitar? 
No. I wish that I did
Same here. Whenever i watch people, it looks so easy to pick up and learn... until you actually try to learn and realize its alot harder than it looks hah. Taking the time to build up muscles in your fingers is hard work.
Its a great musical instrument
This is true. That statement also goes well with piano’s. There’s so many talented artists out there that can play the piano and guitar. Did you know that Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude? That must be a super lucky piano.
Yes. That piano must be worth a bit of money
I could only imagine. I wonder where they keep that piano. 
it should be in the rock and roll hall of fame
As it should be. It would be so awesome to see it in person. 
A long time ago at the fillmore east I saw grand funk railroad. Talk about loud and sparks flying
Oh nice! I haven’t heard of that band until now. What is some popular songs that they have? I want to look them up and give them a listen.
Were an American band, Im your Captain, Some kind of wonderful, are some hits they had in the 1970s
Cool! I’m listening to Were an American band right now, i reeeeaally love the guitar playing!
Mark Farner i think was lead guitar
Nice! Well thank you for opening up my ears to some new awesome music. Now i got some new stuff to listen to. It’s been a pleasure chatting with you about guitars and piano’s. :)
The Hypocrites put on really amusing stage productions!
Yes, I would love to go and check Pirates, Pinafore and the Mikado
i heard that the group does them as a pajama party!
That is a living dream. A pajama party and a live satirical operetta with talented musician clowns. that is something else
The use of a pillow pit might be a little bit disturbing for some!
It might. And it is nice they start with sweet dreams from Eurythmics
live players doing popular music like Dream On as part of the show is surprising!
They play with music and even with toys. They did release beach balls in pirates of penzance, fun
They also swap genders in the production of Pinafore.
the price is not expensive, $30 to $74
Not unexpected, given that the theater only holds 100 or so people.
How much do you like jazz
I dig it.    Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States
It  is fascinating, comes from ragtime and blues and it is called the Classical music of America
Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, and is more modern.
It did spread around the world and gave origin to different styles around the world
It has spread so there is now a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.
Great! I also love the dance-oriented swing big bands like the Kansas city jazz
Many people, even Clint eastwood are lifelong jazz enthusiasts, and scored several films, including million dollar baby
Cool, it is funny that rapper Tupac Shakur studied jazz, acting and poetry.. but became a rapper.
People are often multitalented!    Thanks for the chat!
Did you know that Jazz music originated in New Orleans?
Hello - I did not know that. Do you like jazz music?
It began in the early 1900’s there and became really popular in the 1920’s. I like all styles of music actually.  Rock music, pop music, country, I like it all. 
That’s pretty cool. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees to provide comfort while playing.
That’s interesting to know!  There’s different styles of jazz...Gypsy jazz and Kansas City jazz.
I didn’t know they had those two different styles. That’s really cool.
Yes.  Clint Eastwood is a lifelong jazz fan!
That’s cool. A Harlem woman has held free jazz concerts in her apartment for 20 years now.
Neat!  I bet that is a pain to drag up the guitars and piano  up there.
I bet so too. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra.
Interesting.  I don’t think of jazz when I think of Pakistan. 
Me either lol. Eddie Van Halen set his studio speakers on fire when he recorded the guitar solo for "beat it".
Whoa!  His playing was literally on fire.  lol  Brian May from Queen uses coins as guitar picks.
That’s cool I’ve heard of people using coins before.
It probably would give it a different sound I would think since you’re strumming the strings with a metal and not plastic pick.
I bet you’re right on that. He also has a PHD in astrophysics.
Interesting.  The guitarist from Pink Floyd turned a houseboat into a recording studio.  Crazy stuff.
That’s funny. A group climb Britain’s highest mountain back in 2006 and found a piano on top.
I couldn’t even imagine the ordeal it would have been for whomever had to take that piano up there originally.  An aluminum grand piano weighs 356 pounds and that’s light compared to a regular piano.
Wow that’s much lighter compared to a regular one.
Freddie Mercury used the same piano to record Bohemian Rhapsody that Paul McCartney used to record Hey Jude.
Good talking to you!
Do you like the piano?
Yes, I like the piano. I don’t know how to play it, but I think that it works well in many kinds of music.
There is an aluminum grand piano that weight 356 pounds, Im guessing thats pretty light for a piano like that one
True. That was the one on the Hindenburg. Probably sounded pretty tinny. Aluminum. Hm.
Probably yeah, theres another cool fact about a piano, a group of climbers find one in the strangest of places
I wonder why someone put a piano up there. Did they play it? Did they want others to play it? How did they put it there?
I have no idea how it got there, that is a big mystery can you imagine reaching the top and theres a piano right there
A mystery, like the  mysterious mute man  found wandering the streets in England in 2005 and could only communicate via piano
I didnt hear about that mute man, sounds like an interesting anecdote
Almost as strange as Richard Nixon’s piano concerto, which he wrote and performed it live on the Tonight Show
He did? I dint know he played the piano what other instruments do you like maybe the guitar?
The guitar is totally rad man. I dig it. Since its debut in 1949, the Les Paul Gibson es-175 guitar has never gone out of production.
I like Eddie Van Halen I heard the studio got on fire with one of his solos, so much power in that guitar
He really can shred. Setting the amp on fire! Great! Brian May of Queen built his guitar out of parts from an old fireplace and his mother’s knitting needle. 
How the level of skill and the determination to become a guitarist, he also has a PHD in astrophysics, really intelligent man
True. Cornell university researchers built the world’s smallest guitar,played by a laser, about the size of a red blood cell. I bet Brian May could figure out a way to play that guitar.
I bet he can he can put that PHD in astrophysics and his mad skills as a guitarist to work I think his one of the greatest of all time
The bio-pic of Freddie Mercury did well at the Oscars. Rami Malek won Best Actor. I guess Queen is finally getting recognized by Hollywood.
He won the Oscar right, I thought he nailed it, he was great on that movie, that movie made me cry
Great guitar and piano playing too. Anyway, thanks for the chat!
I agree and also great songs in the movie, the actor that plays Brian May also looks really alike
hELLO
Hi there!
Did you know that on april 18, 1930, the bbc decided there was no news worth reporting, so they broadcast piano music instead.
Really, wow! I wonder how many people had TV then?
Good question.  Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude
cool! ever hears of Eurovision?
No, what’s that?
 Song Contest in england.
Oh ok.  In 2006 a group of climbers reached the top of britain’s highest mountain and found a piano
neat! apparently the competition away from its usual reliance on over-the-top spectacle.
An aluminum grand piano was built for the lounge of the airship hindenburg. it weighed only 356 pounds.
Wow! I did not know that! Portuguese broadcaster RTP had stripped the Eurovision stage of the walls of LED screens that have become ubiquitous backdrops in recent years.
When eddie van halen recorded the guitar solo for "beat it" he literally set the studio speakers on fire.
Oh my gosh! DO you like Jazz?
No, not really.  You?
Some, but Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans.
There is a programming language in which the programs are written in musical composition, and functional programs have jazz-like harmonies.
I had no idea! Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression,
A harlem woman has held free jazz concerts at her apartment every sunday for 20 years. top performers occasionally stop by.
Thats neat! New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass-band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation.
Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.
Clint eastwood is a lifelong jazz enthusiast, pianist, and scored several films, including million dollar baby.
Clint Eastwood movies are awesome
they are/ I like grand Torino especially. what is your fave?
That’s great one.  Unforgiven was awesome
I’ll have to look that one up! Jazz trumpeters grew goatees as it provided comfort when playing.
I didn’t realize that.  That’s very interesting.  Thanks for the chat.
You too! Have a good day!
Thanks have a great day as well
Matthew bellamy from the band muse holds the guinness world record for most guitars smashed on a tour.
Hello, Do you enjoy Jazz?
Hi! I do not have much experience with it, and I hope to rememdy that when we go to New Orleans later this year. I hear that is where it originated.
Yes, it did!! I have been there! You will love it! Lots of music and energy...It was developed from the blues and ragtime.
I guess Pakistan has a very good jazz orchestra.
Really, I didn’t know they like Jazz, that’s interesting! Did you know Jazz trumpeters like to wear a goatee? It gives comfort when playing. Makes sense.
I better not tell my son, or he will be trying to play my daughter’s sax. Clint Eastwood is a jazz fan, and scored several films.
Yes, I heard he is a lifelong pianist! Very cool..In Harlem, in a woman’s apartment for 20 years she holds Jazz concerts. Sometimes top performers stop by! 
I would love to live in that neighborhood. There is a computer program that writes in musical compositions, do you know the name of it?
No what? Did you know there is a piano at the top of Britain’s highest mountain? I would like to see that!
I would have loved to have been in the studio when Eddie Van Halen set the speakers on fire.
I know pretty crazy!! Like when MJ caught his hair on fire! My goodness what’s with the fire? I was interested to know about the computer program you mentioned?
He was recording a solo for Beat It.
Yes, hmmm seems like MJ’s songs can cause fires! lol I think it would be pretty interesting to be on Pink Floyd’s houseboat called Astroria!  It’s a recording studio.
It’s funny the sound that using coins as guitar picks lends to a song. Queens’ guitarist does that.
Yes, he likes the English sixpence.  Did you know Queen’s guitarist has a PHD in astrophysics! Talented and smart.
I would love to have seen the piano made out of aluminum, it was on the Hindenburg.
Really, yes that would be interesting to see. There must be a picture somewhere? 
I would think there would be. I thought the piano was an older instrument, it was invented in 1700’s, not really that old.
True, I love to hike, I can’t imagine climbing to the top of Britain’s highest mountain and finding a piano! I wonder how it holds up in the elements? Maybe it was just there for a time?
That is insane. I want to know more about those who hiked up there, carrying it. Why did they do it?
Yes, maybe it had a fantastic sound when recording? Do you play piano? I took some lesson when I was young and sent my daughter for lessons.
I do not. Thanks for chatting with me, have a great day.
You too! Good chat!!
Thank you.
Are you a fan of jazz by any chance?
I like jazz but cant say I really know much about it.
It’s an interesting genre. Jazz trumpeters grew goatees because it provided comfort when playing. 
that is interesting. Tupac Shakur studied jazz when he was in baltimore school of the arts
I would not have expected that at all. Things may have gone differently for him had he followed that passion. I know that the New Orleans style of jazz started in the 1910’s. 
thats over a 100 years ago. Jazz has been seen as a major form of musical expression since the 1920’s 
That is an old form of music especially compared to the most popular forms of music now. Pakistan has a jazz orchestra that is currently topping the charts.
I never new that . Did you know that louis armstrong ended the beatles three months on the billboard top 100
WOW! I didn’t think anything could stop The Beatles. No offence to Armstrong but I know a lot more people that still listen to The Beatles. 
This is a pretty interesting guitar fact,  A dial tone is in the key of f, serving as a pre-internet trick to tune your guitar
WOW! That’s clever. I enjoy guitar music. Queen’s guitarist, Brian may, has a PHD in astrophysics.
he also built a guitar out of parts from an old fire place and his mothers knitting needles . super smart
Yes. Honestly all of Queen always struck me as a very intelligent group of men. I am also a big fan. 
I agree. did you know that the nokia ringtone  from a 1902 composition by spanish classical guitarist and composer francisco tarrega, called gran vals.
I did not. It’s been so long that I honestly can’t remember what that sounded like. I wonder where the iPhone ring tone came from because I hear that everywhere lol. 
have you ever heard about a mute man from england that could only communicate to others with a piano
I had not heard that but it’s actually quite touching that he could find a way. Speaking of piano, Freddie mercury used the same piano to record bohemian rhapsody as paul mccartney used to record hey jude.
thats interesting 
I thought so. I can’t play piano but I enjoy the sound. If I had the room a player piano would be nice. 
I like pianos I would like to learn how play one. they used to have steam piano and they were audible for miles
That must have been extremely loud up close. 
Hi, how are doing over there on this fine evening?
I am good thanks. How are you?
I’m doing groovy over here. Are you a fan of tennis? 
Not so much. I heard that the longest tennis match in history went on for 11 hours. I definitely would not want to watch that.
What if you had money on it though? That would make it worth it. 
I think I would be more interested in the helicopter that dried the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.
I guess hair dryers were not powerful enough then. A helicopter? That’s a rich person’s solution. 
And wait, grass tennis court? I wonder how well the ball bounced. Probaby grass cut really short but still.
Yeah, there are three kinds of courts. I guess grass has its effect on the ball. Do you use Google much?
Oh yeah, more than I shoud. I know I’m not the only one. In 2013 Google went down for five minutes and took 40 percent of web traffic with it.
People are so dependent on the Internet. If civilization collapsed, the first thing they would do is search Google for a solution.
Kind of related, but I have totally tried to Google things when my power is out. Haha.
We can’t help it! Easy to get knowledge that provides answers to daily problems. Not there when I was a kid. 
Google’s unofficial slogal is "Don’t be evil" but I sometimes think it is evil. They calculate traffic by tracking how fast Android devices are moving on the road.
They are spying on us, even right now! But they do like dogs, which is pretty good right there.
And they did hire live goats to mow their lawns once. That is pretty kewl.
I would become a goat there if it got me stock options. 
Haha. So speaking of Google, I just Googled Borg vs. McEnroe. It is about one of the greatest tennis games ever played. Would you watch it?
I would watch. I don’t think I’d bet on the outcome though. Isn’t there some movie about them two?
Yes I think that is the title. Shia LaBeouf stars as McEnroe. I am not really too into sports movies.
It’s probably mostly about personalities. McEnroe was intense. Borg was Swedish. That’s enough personality for one film.
Haha, hilarious. I will have to check it out!
Hello!  Are you a tennis fan or do you play?
No, my dad used to, though. It seems like it’s too intense for me
I only tried playing in college to kill time.  I stunk up the courts I was so bad.  The longest tennis match in history went on for over 11 hours and was spread over 2 days.  Crazy.
Was that at one of the big competitions, like an open or Wimbledon?
I’m not sure.  They once had to use a helicopter to dry the grass courts for the 1969 US open.  Bet that dried it fast.
That was the year after the first open when a black player won. But no black player has won since
Wow.  I didn’t know that.  Polo shirts were originally invented by a tennis player and were later adopted by polo players.  Interesting.
So maybe we should really be calling them tennis shirts? Just like sneakers are often called tennis shoes
lol  Good point!  They say that 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.  I question that... lol
Same. How do people know? How many pairs have survived since then? And what constitutes better performance?
I have no idea.  I bet those would be some smelly shoes though!  They say putting a dry tea bag inside smelly shoes will absorb the unpleasant odor.  I’ll have to try that to try that on my smelly stinky shoes. Lol lol
Oh wow, I never knew that. I actually have a huge problem with that, so that will help. Surprised I didn’t learn that when I googled solutions to that problem (which I’ve done like 100 times)
I’m a big googler myself.  A single google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon. Crazy how far technology has come since then.
I can’t even begin to understand how that makes sense. Then again, I guess computing was done a lot by people by hand back in the 60’s
When google went down for 5 minutes in 2013 it took 40 percent of the web traffic with it.  I don’t remember that.
I don’t remember that either, but it makes sense. Did you know that Google as a company officially prefers dogs over cats?!
I didn’t know that.  I know at one time they used hundreds of live goats to mow the lawns around their headquarters.  They really like their animals.
Yeah! I guess it wasn’t too cost effective to do that with the goats, otherwise they’d keep doing it. Pretty energy efficient, though
I agree!  Good was founded in 1998.  I could have sworn I remember using it before then.
I remember being told about it by a teacher in 1999 or 2000. Like I remember her writing it on the board and another teacher telling us it was an intentional misspelling of the number googol
Interesting!  I have to get going.  It was nice chatting with you!  Have a good night!
Hello, do you follow tennis?
Not really. I just know each player uses a strung racket and they hit a hollow ball.
Did you know Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis?
I did know. I know Lacoste shirts had the crocodile and it was a symbol for Rene "the crocodile" lacoste who was a famous player.
Yep. A black man won the first US open tennis title back in 1968 and no black man has won it since.
Wow! Over 50 years and still holding the record! I think the next year in 1969 they used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the US open.
I agree. They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US open.
Yes, they did. The longest tennis match went on for 11 hours over three days. I bet they were exhausted!
That’s crazy long! 
I agree! It’s amazing the facts you can find on Google. Did you know that a single Google search requires more computing power than it took to send Neil Armstrong to the moon?
That’s pretty amazing! I saw that Google maps calculates traffic by how fast Android devices are moving on the road.
I never knew that! I wonder whose? I know I heard that back in the day Google used goats to keep the lawn under control instead of hiring people to mow.
That’s hilarious! Google went down for 5 minutes back in 2013 and took 40% of the web traffic with it.
I can imagine. I use it a lot. It’s hard to believe its only been around since 1998.
I agree. When there is a dispute on a border, Google maps tailors the map to the claims of each country where the internet browser is located.
That sounds logical. I wish I would have gotten on board with the 2004 initial public offering to buy stock. I can’t even imagine the outcome.
I can’t either. Do you like shoes?
I love shoes!! I know that shoes made 5000 years ago perform better than today’s shoes!
That’s pretty amazing they perform better than the shoes of today!
I agree. I can’t see how though. I find it amazing the array of choices like ones that can cost thousands of dollars a pair.
It was good chatting with you!
Hello do you like tennis?
Yes. Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or doubles.
Yes,  thanks for the explaination.  Did you know that polo shirts were made originally for tennis players?
Yes, It is more comfortable to wear while playing, and it also make the popular of the shirts.
They used a helicopter to dry the grass in the 1969 us open lol
In 19th century, modern tennis is originated in England as Lawn tennis.
Nice,  sounds fun!  The longest tennis match went on for 3 days!  can you imagine?
When this match happened ?
I think around 2015
Thanks. The main component of tennis is racket until 1978 a tennis player was allowed to use absolutely any object as racket.
Thats interesting!  
Google was founded in 1998. It is an American multinational technology company that is specialized in internet-related services.
Seems like a long time ago even though it wasnt.  
It is the biggest search engine and cloud computing service. It also many application like gmail, youtube, etc...
Yes,  I recently read that a google search requires more computing power than it took to send astronauts to the moon lol
Google is the most valuable brand in 2017. Google announced the new company called Calico.
wow awesome.  Instead of hiring people to mow the lawn,  they hired goats.  
The company moved to mobile android system the Chrome OS is the light weight operating system.
ok.  I recently read that they calculate the taffic by how fast android phones are moving. 
It is very interesting thing. Technology are used to identify were are we. It affect the privacy of person.
I agree.  Its been good chatting. 
Do you like tennis? I just love to play the sport.
I’ve played it a couple time in high school gym class, I wasn’t that good
i love it! Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or in teams
I watch it sometimes when Serena Williams is playing
yeah i like to watch her play. Polo shirts were originally invented for tennis by famous player rene "the crocodile" lacoste. i love their colgne for men
Intresting, the longest match played in a polo shirt was 22 hours
yeah if i recall it went over three days or so
That’s a long time, I don’t think I’ve ever done anything for 3 days straight
im not sure if its true but Us open quarterfinalist gael monfils beat the "roger federer of paddle tennis" after learning how to play just days earlier.
Man that’s crazy, almost as crazy as using a helicopter to dry grass tennis courts
yeah i have heard that as well and though it sounded really dangerous. i wonder if their were people in the crowd?
I hope not, if I was there I’d be cold
yeah. In 1998, serena and venus williams said they could beat any man ranked 200 or worse in a game of tennis. they lost when challenged twice lol
lol, well she did win the australian open when she was ranked 95th
i have heard Serena williams is a co-owner of the miami dolphins
I didn’t know that, she speaks french and italian so I wonder if she owns any sports teams in Europe
not sure but In january 2007, serena williams was ranked 95th in the world in tennis
I never knew she was ever ranked that low
well she reached the No. 1 ranking for the first time on July 8, 2002 but has since fallen
Wow, shes so good though, she won a grand slam while pregnant
I guess in my opinion her and her sister are kinda overated.
I don’t know, maybe
Have you heard of the new "First Man" film starring Ryan Gosling?
No, I have not.  Please tell me about it.
It’s a space movie.  He plays the character of Neil Armstrong.  It was released Friday.
Did you watch the movie?  Was it really a space movie?
I haven’t seen it yet.  Today was the first time I heard of it.
It is hard to talk about this movie if we both have not seen it.  Can we change the topic?
Let’s talk about Earth.  It’s the third planet from the sun.  
Apparently, 80 percent of the earth’s natural forests have already been destroyed.  It’s depressing to me.
That is sad for sure.  Sad that people are the cause of it too.
When the earth was first formed, there was only 5.5 hours long in a day.  
Wow.  I didn’t know that.  71 percent of the earth’s surface is covered by water.  I wonder what covers the polar regions?
Ice?  I am not sure though.  Apparently, earth will be helium free by the end of the 21st century.
Yes.  Ice is right.  It’s almost like the history of the earth is like watching a science fiction movie only in real life.
I like science fiction.  I like to imagine things, like aliens in a different planet.
Do you like Starship Troopers?  
Yes, because it is the only science fiction novel recommended by three branches of the military.  I wonder why they recommended it though - do you know?
I have no idea.  lol  The word robotics was made up by a book writer - Isaac Asimov.  Seems like robots and space are always a big theme for science fiction books and movies. 
By the way, do you know that the United Nations appointed an ambassador to greet extraterrestrials in case they want to say hello to us?
That’s interesting!  What a job to have!  That’s just like something out of the movie Star Wars, which came out in 1977 and the value of that franchise is now $65 billion dollar! 
Wow.  That is a lot of money.  I heard that it is currently the 5th largest grossing media franchise. 
Initially 20th century fox was convinced that Star Wars was going to be a flop.  Wow we’re they wrong.
They were wrong indeed.  George Lucas got a better deal by forgoing $500k directing fee.
James Earl Jones only made $7,500 for 2 1/2 hours of work providing the voice for Darth Vader.  Thought he would have spent more time and made more money recording that voice.
I do not think $7500 is a lot of money to provide Darth Vader’s voice because the movie was very successful.  What do you think?
I wonder if the actors get any royalties from the movie?  
They should.  George Lucas should be generous since he got so much money from Star Wars.
You would think!  He’s a billionaire from the movie!
Rich people are often cheap.
That’s sad...but so true.  I’ve seen it too much during my working lifetime where the people at the top get richer and the workers on the factory floor just barely have enough money to live on.
I wonder if someone was fired at fox because of George Lucas deal. Anyway, I’ve got to run.  Nice chatting with you.
Dogs or cats?
Hi! I have two cats, but want a dog. You?
I like dogs more, but dont mind cats! Google likes dogs more though
Hah. I see their code of conduct state they are a DOG company. 
lol, I heard you can bring you dog to work while working there, kind of discriminating against cats though!
Kinda odd since dogs are normally louder and more likely to poop somewhere. Looks like Istanbul even has vending machines to release food and water for strays.
that is a great point! The US needs to get those vending machines, I would donate so many plastic bottles. That is nice of that country
I wonder where else the dogs go if not for vencing machines?
right, they probably go for trash cans unfortunately. Did you know dogs have 12 types of blood?
Makes sense for variety. Apparently they have doggie blood drives too!
that would be so awesome to volunteer at. I will have to look them up. Did you know dogs and elephants are the only animals that respond to pointing, sorry cats
My cats responding to pointing, and throwing.
That is true, so I wonder if there are more we don’t know about lol. Do you like horses at all?
I took a horse ride once and live in an area with lots of horses. They are beautiful animals. you?
They are so beautiful, I like petting them but never rode one. I wouldn’t ride Icelandic horses because they are super fast.
I wonder if riders trained horses to do that?
I am sure they did. I just wouldn’t ride horses to school on no vehicle day and get suspended like two students did. I feel that was pointless
That’s funny and rather stupid at the same time.
For sure lol, it was so nice talking with you, say hi to your cats for me!
My cats will run away, but sure!
lol! bye now!
Crazy that early humans used to have to battle giant sloths! Who would’ve thought?
I know right! Humans have been around for a long time apparently I mean we lost our body hair 240,000 years ago!
Yea that’s really interesting. I never knew humans could regrow a rib bone that has been surgically shortened, either.
No I didn’t know that either. I wonder if other animals can do that? Like can we Harvest Pig ribs for food and then they will regrow that way we don’t have to kill the pig haha
That would be awesome! I’m sure science will figure that out someday! We can already use our current technology to date the extinction of ground sloths and determine where ancient human footprints led to.
That’s really cool. I would love to see that. They should put that in the movie! I think it’s cool that humans are adapted for persistence running. We are some of the best animals in the world at it
Haha yea that would be cool. That’s really surprising humans are the best at persistence running! I wouldn’t have guessed that. As long as those pesky hiccups don’t attack while running! Darn evolution leftovers!
Haha yep hiccups are so annoying! So is that frequency that causes fear in humans ,have you heard about that LOL?
No, I had not. So fear comes from sound...? I thought it had to do with the autonomic nervous system, fight or flight thing? That would be really interesting to look into further. 
Can come from sound. And yes I’m going to look into that further as well. Do you like any animals by the way?
I used to own two cats, no current pets though. I would love to go to Japan and play with some cats at a cat cafe though! haha
Haha that does seem like a great idea! Get a drink and pet a cat LOL. Did you know that a cat will spend 10 years of its life sleeping when it’s only 15 years old LOL that’s a long time
That is nuts! What I wouldn’t give to trade places! Or trade places with Stubbs, the cat who is the mayor of Talkeentna, Alaska! Sounds like a sweet gig.
It does sound awesome! I don’t know what kind of work she does but she must be doing a great job lol have you ever seen the movie The Godfather by the way
Right? Haha And yea I’ve seen the Godfather but it’s been a while.
Well in the opening scene the cat that they use, I don’t know if you remember that part, but it was actually a stray apparently
Yea, I vaguely remember, that’s awesome. Another sweet gig for a cat! Now if only I woulda thought to have one of my cats coauthor a book with me. I guess some physicist did so so that he could use the first person plural without being criticized!
That is funny! What do you think about Scotland putting a lot in place to protect the Loch Ness monster? Do you think that means he might exist LOL
Haha that is strange. It definitely makes one wonder...maybe the loch ness is some super secret scientific experiment or military weapon? Haha I guess thanks to the Germans, who in 2002 were the first to give animals constitutionally guaranteed legal rights, Scotland can do what it wants concerning the Loch Ness!
The Loch Ness monster should have legal rights to! Did you know that there are 20 quintillion individual animals on planet Earth. I have no idea how many zeros that is but I know it is a lot LOL
Haha that is insane. How does anyone even figure out that there’s that many animals?! Interesting that domesticated animals develop a white patch on their forehead. I wonder what that’s about?
I know right. like will a fish get a patch of white on its forehead?the only animals that have that that I’ve ever seen our dogs, so I just don’t know LOL
Hi, Do you like to cook?
I love to cook. just not in july when it is so hot.
Right, it’s no fun when it is hot and you’re trying to cook. We like to grill a lot outside, which helps not make our home more hot.
Grilling out is the best to help with the heat inside the house. If I have to cook in the house i do it early in the morning before it gets too hot.
Yes that’s another great idea. We also sometimes eat out if it is way too hot, or eating something like salads or cereal. Where we aren’t using heat at all.
That is a great idea. We tend to eat leftovers too and just use the micorwave.
The microwave is great and fast, I agree. Making Icecream is a great way to cool down when it gets too hot. We also tend to use box fans.
We use a fan for sure. Also started using like a slow cooker or toaster oven not as hot and now can fit up to a whole chicken.
Great appliances help to cook! We love our air-fryer. Though it tends to eat up the area some, so we open the doors and dim the lights to help with the heat.
I heard some people turn their wrist upside down  to get their blood flowing to stay cool.
Wow great information, I will have to try that sometime. Do you like to eat fish or even go fishing?
I love to fish. the oldest goldfish lived to be 43 years old
Wow that is a long life for a goldfish! I like to go crabbing too. I heard the seahorse is the only fish with a neck, I
THere was a koi fish that lived 226 years
Whoa! That is crazy to know and interesting. I know there is a breed of jellyfish that is immortal.
Cool the barreleye fish has a transparent head.
Awesome. I heard that saltwater fish dink water through their mouths and through their skin, while a freshwater fish only drinks through their skin. Fish are fascinating.
That is pretty cool. Do you like to bird watch?
There are times when i Do like to look at the birds, how about you? Did you know that birds bones are really hollow. So hollow in fact that their skeleton weighs less than their feathers.
thats neat. They have then thousand living species.
That’s cool. Some birds are known to fly from Alaska to mexico without sleeping, that is tiring to think about.
o wow. I wonder how many days that takes. Scientist say birds have regional accents.
That is cool how they even have accents like humans. My favorite is the hummingbird, they are tiny sometimes about 2 inches long.
They are the smallest birds and the ostrich is the biggest. Some birds don’t fly.
This reminds me of the extinct dodo bird. They were actually a sub-family of pigeons.
pigeons are one of 3 birds that produce milk for their young.
Very cool. Pigeons are very pretty birds.
Hi do you like tennis?
Oh yeah! I pick up a racket and hit the net when I can!
Nice!  Did you know that polo shirts were invented for tennis and only later adopted by polo players?
Ha! That’s weird! I didn’t know that! Tennis has an interesting history. Did you know that until 1978, a tennis player could use any object as a racket?
Nice!  I wonder if anyone ever tried to use something wacky?  A black man won the 1st US open tennis title in 1968 and no black man has won it since.
Wow! Not since 1968? You know, Serena Williams has increasingly found her voice and spoken out against gender and racial inequality. 
Yes!  Did you know that she speaks fluent French and Italian, as does her sister Venus!
She is truly fascinating! She does it all! She is the first tennis player, male or female, to achieve the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. That means she won at least one Australian Open title, French Open title, Wimbledon title, US Open title, and Olympic Gold medal.
That’s pretty incredible!  They used a helicopter to dry the grass tennis courts for the 1969 US Open.
That’s a little before Serena’s time! Although, did you know she went pro in tennis at the age of 13?! I could barely even get a ball over the net when I was 13!
lol  I do remember that.  Both her and her sister brought alot of good publicity to the sport.
That is for sure! Two girls from Compton came and conquered! In total, Serena has been Number 1 for 319 weeks! 
That is incredible!  The longest match in tennis history went on for 11 hours and was spread over 3 days.  Wow!
Are you kidding me! Three days?! That’s a long time! I don’t have that kind of patience! Speaking of long records... did you know the longest point in pro tennis history was a 643 shot rally? 
Wow!  That would have been fun to watch...not so fun for the players. lol
Yeah! It lasted 29 minutes! I bet it was pretty exhilarating, but also probably pretty exhausting! I would certainly be out of breath after 29 minutes!
lol me too.  Are you a fan of rap music?
Oh yeah! Tennis reminds me a little of rap, since they’re both so fast paced. Did you know the world’s fastest rapper can rap at a rate of 14.1 syllables per second?
Holy smokes I wouldn’t be able to listen that fast!  lol  It’s been fun chatting with you!
Then maybe you could try the deaf rapper, Signmark. He rhymes in sign language! You don’t have to listen at all! I’m going to go try to find some on the internet. Goodbye!
I’ll have to look him up!  Have a great night!
What do you think of Serena Williams?
I really like her! 
Have you seen the Nike ads?
I haven’t but I hear they are really powerful messages in this age of people stepping forward about sexual harassment.
It is all about there is no wrong way to be a woman.
Yes, ans inequality among races and gender. I like Serena.
I really think she is a great driving force and a good role model to girls.
Yes, definitely! I agree. She is happy to have such a powerful platform to try and pave the way for upcoming generations. 
Very true.  Did you now polo shirts were initially invented be a famous tennis player?
That is interesting! Did you know in Tennis years ago you were allowed to use any object as your racket? Haha
Really, like a shoe?
Any object! So yes lol....must have been interesting!! As funny as if you grunt...before a shot...it is by some considered to be cheating!
Really, there is so much grunting in tennis.  The longest match was 11 hours long over 3 days!
Wow, I could never last that long! Speaking of Serena Williams, I didn’t know she went pro at age 13! That is amazing....and she is co owner of the Miami Dolphins...wow!
She co-owns the dolphins and was a pro at 13!  Wow, she is really incredible.
I think she is! Speaking of amazing...imagine this...the worlds fastest rapper can rap 14.1 syllables per second! 
That is crazy, can anyone even understand that?
I am not sure but I would love to hear it! Talk about funny, McDonald’s at one time paid rappers 5 bucks every time they said Big Mac in their songs hahahaa....crazy
I bet they were dropping Big Mac lines like crazy!
I bet they were too! lol! There is even a rapper who is deaf! he raps in sign language, very interesting!
Wow, Id like to watch that.  Great Chat!  Have a great night!
hi how are you doing over there on that side of the internets
Hi! Hope you’re doing well! So are you a fan of The Walt Disney Company? One of my favorite characters is Minnie Mouse and I was surprised to recently find out her name is short for Minerva Mouse!
i like disney though i havent watched a disney film in a while. i do like minnie. she is cute as the dickens.
Well there’s actually a hidden subculture dedicated to finding hidden Mickey mouse images in all things Disney, you should definitely check out!
i guess if you find a mickey, you win something? if i find one, i guess i should tell others and not keep it secret.
That’s a good point! Ha! Unless they change the locations up!  Are you also a fan of Bill Nye? He actually served as a science consultant on Flubber, believe it or not!
i guess he knows a bit about the science of hypothetical substances. he is an entertaining fellow for sure.
Indeed he is! I also think it’s amazing that Big Hero 6 was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer. That is amazing!
that is astonishing. i wonder how many processors theyll need for big hero 7. i dint see the other big hero movies.
Probably a lot more than 55,000. Ha! Did you ever see Wall-E? If so, the name is actually a tip of the hat to Walter Elias Disney himself!
that is cute. i wondered why they pickt such a strange name for a robot but now i see. but he dint have a mustache.
You’re right, I don’t think he did! Ha! I’d like to see Wall-E with factual hair like Kanye West’s. I bet that’d be funny. Speaking of Kanye, you know he believes aids is man made? 
yes Kanye is an oddball when it comes to science. 
That is true. But he does do cool stuff every now again like the time he gave his mic to a fan in a wheelchair at one of his concerts. That was nice of him!
i think that he undersatnds entertainment good but he doesnt have the knowledge for science. 
True. I loved how he did an SNL skit where he mocked himself interrupting award shows ironically two years before he interrupted Taylor Swift at an award show. Ha!
he knew the depths of his depravity and told the whole world first. i think that is honest of him 
Agreed. Since we’re on the subject of rap, are you a fan of Tupac. I’m so glad his music is in the library of Congress of cultural significance. He was a talented musician!
Tupac is not my cup of tea but the man could rap the street an urban lullaby. Anyway, great chat!
Indeed he could! I also think Eminem can as well. I’m glad he became a rapper instead of becoming a comic book artist as he wanted to do growing up. Oh what might have been!
he could still DO that! the man has got years in front of him and tales of the street to tell. Have a good one!
So true. And speaking of Eminem, it’s hilarious the judge who was trying a suit against Eminem back in 2001 delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Glad some judges still have a sense of humor. Ha! Well it was great chatting with you! Take care!
You too! have a good night!
You have a good evening as well. I’m off to watch the Rugrats movie to see if I recognize Busta Rhymes’ voice in it as the Reptar wagon. Ha! Take care!
Disney Land & World released officlal Mickey Mouse ears - rainbow colors - for Pride Month recently. Disney??? When did they wake upd & get tolerant??
Yeah that is interesting. I guess they started that in 2018, it sounds like a lot of people on Twitter were upset too
About Pride Month or something else?
I think they were mad that one of the rapper’s was supporting president Trump, and they were very happy to hear that Disney was making the LGBT ears or something like that, I don’t pay attention to Twitter so I’m not a hundred percent sure
Got it. Yeah, the rapper is Kanye West. Another singer, John Legend, asked West to "reconsider"
Speaking of Disney, what are you like about their movies? Did you know that for instance Minnie Mouse’s real name is Minerva LOL
Nope. Glad they used the nickname, Minnie. What’s your favorite Disney film?
I really like The Little Mermaid and I also like The Lion King, what about you? I don’t really like Wall-e myself
Lion King was a fav of mine. Loved James Earl Jones, who voiced the father lion character. Little Mermaid had some great music like "Under the Sea". Disney is a huge studio today
Yes I agree with you! I also like the movie Big Hero 6, have you seen it? Apparently it was rendered using a 55000 core supercomputer
Haven’t seen. Wonder what that computer looks like - Apple makes a lot of computers used by artists & filmmakers.
Yep you’re right about that. Back to Kanye West though, what do you think about him giving a mic to one of his fans in a wheelchair at a concert? That was nice of him
Agree, but calling Trump a "brother" went too far. Trump is no bro! Kanye is big music celeb, though.
Yeah, he’s definitely an interesting guy, his ideas are not always good though, for instance he thinks that aids is a man-made disease
Heard that. Since when did people create viruses like HIV? West has made a lot of big $$$ producing records, fwith influences from soul, to electro to gospel.
Yes that’s a really crazy thing. Kind of like when he mocked himself on SNL for interrupting someone at an awards show, and then did it in real life to Taylor Swift, definitely the guy has some issues
Think so. His main genre, Rap, is huge, though. Has lots of components, like what is said, rhythm or flow, and tone. Are you a fan of Rap?
Yes I do like rap. I mostly like Tupac Shakur stuff, apparently some of his music is in the Library of Congress actually
’bout time. Some folks say Rap/hip-hop definitely has West African roots - and is based on religious worship. 
Yeah I can see that. I would like to see a compliment battle actually, those are really popular in Korea, I think it’s a much more positive thing than a diss battle that I usually see
Great idea. Some rap lyrics don’t seem to have anything to do w/praise, do they?
Yes, mostly they are meant to make fun of other people LOL but I think a compliment battle is actually a very smart thing and would promote positivity
Humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago. Do you know ?
That is fascinating, also like the evidence scientists discovered in New Mexico, ancient humans against giant sloths.
Scientists recently found a human print inside a ground sloth’s paw marks.
It must be really popular as each year about 500,000 people visit the museum, humans dont stop to amaze me!
NIce! Animals and plants synthesize their own vitamin c, But humans cannot.
That sure is an interesting fact, you know humans can regrow ribs and they will be as strong as before in about 2-3 months
Yes, But there is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans.
I bet that frequency is used a lot in horror films.
Yes. Both human and animals are live together. I make our eco-system. The special branch of science to study animals is called zoology.
Its amazing how there are more than 7 million species of animals and there are more to discover.
There are about 20 quintillion animals on planet earth.
Wow, that is a lof animals for sure, you know that animals have constitutional rights in Germany?
In 1912 Scottish protection of animals act, the loch ness monster is a protected species.
Really? I though the Loch Ness monster was a myth, or maybe its a  safety measure in case they actually discover the monster.
Alaska has had a cat named stubbs as its mayor since 1997.
I wonder how mayor Stubbs makes all the decisions lol, did you watch the movie The Godfather?
There are cat cafes in Japan and Taiwan where people can pay hourly to play with cats and have drinks.
Not sure if I would pay for that lol, do you have a cat?
Yes, Its very naughty and its one of family memebers.
I also have a cat, Ive always wondered what breed it is since there are over 70 breeds registered.
Amazing! Its very nice to hear this.
You know the cat in The Godfather, well it was actually a stray cat that happened to be around the set, I bet its life change forever as it is now a movie star.
do you know much about humans?
I know that we lost the body hair only quarter of a million years ago
pretty recent. Do you know why we are good persistence runners?
that is because we used to be hunters and that came in handy
yeah. Did you know we are the only ones that cannot synthesize vitamin c ourselves?
yeah we are missing the enzyme that helps with that
Yeah. Did you know there is a sound frequency that scares us?
I really want to know what that sounds like
Me too. ANd we can regrow ribs if they are surgically removed
yes and in only 2-3 months and just as strong as before
Yeah. Do you know how many individual animals are there?
About 20 quintillion but I have no idea how many zeroes it has
Haha true. Do you have a pet?
I have a dog and two cats, and you?
I have just a dog. Do your pets have white patches in the forehead?
they do not but I hear domesticated animals develop them, weird
Yeah I know  mine do not have them either, confusing a bit
Agreed. DO you know why we have hiccups?
that us from back in the day when animals had gills and lungs
Yeah. Do you know what the Loch Ness Monster is?
Yes that is the believed to be monster in Scotland
Do you like Tennis?
I do not, but I am a fan of Serena Williams, ever since she voiced a character in Avatar; The Last Airbender.
I didn’t know she did that.  She speaks fluent French and Italian.
She’s great. There is a rapper who is deaf, and rhymes in sign language.
That is interesting.  Tupac Shakur’s music is in the library of congress of "cultural significance"
Did you know that Serena Williams co-owns the Miami Dolphins?
I didn’t know that.  In 2007 she was ranked 95th in the world.
It’s hilarious that McDonalds pays rappers $5 for each time they mention big macs in songs. I’m surprised one hasn’t just said "big mac’ the entire time.
lol true!  Big Mac sounds like it would be a good rapper name.  Eminem’s true dream was to become a comic book artist before he was a rapper.
Donald Glover’s name came from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. I would have loved to have seen how many he rejected, before settling on "Childish Gambino".
I know right?  Korean rappers invented a new type of freestyle rap called "compliment battle"  Never heard of that before.
It’s fascinating to know that the term "hip hop" comes from the 16th century, and means "to converse".
I didn’t know that.  In 2001 a Michigan judge delivered a ruling in the form of a rap when judging over a suit filed against Eminem.  I bet that was funny to hear in the court room.
That is funny. It is asinine that grunting can be considered cheating in tennis. How insane is that?
I agree.  It’s always so quiet during tennis matches.
I would have liked to have seen the matches when they were permitted to use anything as a racket. I think they ended that in the 70’s.
That would have been interesting.  Polo shirts were originally invented bor tennis and later adopted for polo players.
I just admire Serena for speaking up for women’s rights, even though it comes at a great personal cost to her. She truly is a warrior for women.
I agree.  In 1998 she shaid that both she and her sister Venus could beat any man ranked 200 or worse.  
I have zero ideas how rankings work in tennis. I think it is appalling for a little girl to be told she was too black for tennis whites. That is the epitome of racism right there.
You know it!  
Hi Do you know that disney has a new line of Mickey ears 
AWWW, really? How cute and I would love to get some for my kids. I love Minnie her actually name is Minerva. Cute.
Wall e was given that name to remember walter disney
How adorable. I never knew that. We are really into the subcultural of finding the hidden mickey mouse image in all things disney, its a fun hobby. 
yeah had seen few videos of the easter eggs of mickey in every production
Oh wow, thats cool. I never heard about that one either. I know Bill Nye was involved with disney, he is a funny scientist. 
for flubber well pretty rare to involve a scientist for a fictional movie. . good move by the team
Yea, good point. It was a great movie and well done. I havent watched it in a really long time though. Disney changed its name in 1986. They make bold moves.
bold moves  may be a  album with Kanye west would be boldest and unimaginable
Oh boy, yeah. Kayne West I heard that he believes AIDS is a man made disease. huh?
really ? I think something is wrong with that man
Yeah, odd thinking. He also did a skit about interrupting on awards show 2 years prior to really doing it. The skit was on SNL and he was mocking himself.  
still could not to resist to do it with taylor . Oh boy he truly know about his future may be he was feeling dejavu
Yeah, good point. Out of the top 10 most successful songs of all time is one of his actually.
pretty much unbelievable may be he should save his talent only for music and avoid talk shows
Thats some sound advice! His Gold Digger song was really fun to listen to but thats about it.
Do you know that eminem’s dream is to become a comic book artist
No way, really? I like him but never knew that. I heard that Tupac has music in the library of congress as cultural significance,. That is pretty cool, I think.
Once a judge gave her ruling in form of Rap where eminem is charged 
HA, thats pretty clever! I guess that Eminem had a favorite character and it was Spiderman. Good thing he stayed with music and rapping.
good chatting with you
Are you a fan of Disney?
I am, my favorite movie is probably Lion King. What about you?
Lion King rocks! I think they are making a new one really soon. I liked Beauty and the Beast and even Moana was great
I really enjoyed the soundtrack of Moana. Beauty and the Beast also had a pretty good one.
For sure! Did you ever watch Big Hero 6?
I have, it was an excellent movie. What about you?
I liked it a lot, I never knew it was Disney too much while watching it, apparently it was rendered with a 55,000 core supercomputer
Talk about high tech! Bill Nye was a scientist consultant for Disney’s flubber!
no way! That is awesome, I never knew that. lol. Bill Nye is the man!
Pixar also named wall-e after walter elais disney.
that is a nice shout out to walter disney. I like the other shout outs too, there is a subculture dedicated to finding hidden mickey mouse images in disney things
Speaking of mickey mouse, Minnie mouse was short for Minerva mouse.
no way, all these short names, I never knew that! I wonder where the name Minerva went
Do you listen to rap music?
I used to love listening to Rap music, not so much anymore, but still enjoy it. How about you?
I do not listen to them too much as I prefer other types of music.
I like Korean Rap, they have compliment rap battles lol
Ah, the infamous k-pop. I have listened to some of that here and there.
Me too, even North Korea has a form of kpop. It was so nice chatting with you!
It was nice chatting with you too! Thank you for you time!
Thank you also, enjoy your night!
Hello. Do you like the Star Wars movies?
I love them! some of my favorites. how about you?
I love them too.  I’ve even read some of the books and played a few star wars video games.
oh what games have you played? I used to play a lot of them but the more recent ones havent been great
Some of the older ones. I can’t remember the names off the top of my head but one was a race game, where you raced in ships on different planets/tracks.
oh probably the Episode 1 podracer game. that was a goood one. I cant believe how successful its become after George Lucas made that one movie way back in the 70s
I know.  Hey, did you know that his wife worked on the movie too?  She even won an academy award.
she did?? what for?
She did some editing work on some scenes.  She worked on obi wan’s death, leia’s good luck kiss, and the trench run.
thats awesome. Did you know Ewan McGregors brother goes by Obi-Two?
No I didn’t but that’s neat!  I don’t think I asked, but what games do you or did you play?
I played the old Super Star Wars games on the SNES, and Knights of the Old Republic on Xbox. Those games were awesome
Those sound familiar.  Yeah, the older games and movies were better.  Speaking of older, i heard that James Earl Jones only spent a little over two hours recording his Darth Vadar lines and he was paid $7500.  I imagine he’d make a lot more if he were doing that today.
he probably would make no less than 100k a day! that voice is so iconic
It really is.  The Force Awakens movie just didn’t do him or Vader justice in my opinion.
you see I liked Force Awakens a lot. I like Kylo Ren. its a different spin because he conflicted and not just all big bad and evil
Okay, I got my new movies mixed up. I liked kylo ren too. What I didn’t like is seeing Hans Solo die if that’s the right movie. The one  I meant about vadar was the new movie about a young darth vadar.
oh yea Han died in Force Awakens. did you know Star Wars is technically responsible for Titanic and Avatar existing?
No I didn’t. How is that?
James Cameron decided to join the film industry after watching star wars, he drected those 2 films
I guess Star Wars is inspiring in more ways than one!
Hey there what do you think about planet Earth? It’s amazing that Earth has only one natural satellite aka the Moon
Oh, really? That is really interesting.
It is interesting, but something that’s sad is that four-fifths of the world’s natural forests have been destroyed. We need to do better with the planet I think
I think so too. I can’t believe when the earth was first formed, one day was 5.5 hours long!
I know right! do you think that days are getting longer overtime? Like will we have a 40 hour day at some point in the future
I’m not sure, but I hope not, that is way too long!
What do you think about the United Nations appointing an ambassador to extraterrestrials? I wonder what he does all day, sounds like the most boring job in the world because obviously we haven’t had contact yet
It must be very boring. If we ever do have contact, I wonder if they would tell us?
That’s a good point! Scary thing about our current trajectory is that Earth will be out of helium by the year 2100, I know that you love him very important for manufacturing things so I don’t know what we’ll do
It’s very scary to think about, hopefully we don’t.
What other interesting fact, is that if all of history was 24 hours, humans would only take up about 1 minute worth of the 24 hours, isn’t that wild to think about?
It’s very interesting. It’s amazing how long the earth has sustained life.
Yes Earth has been around for a long time for sure. So interesting to me is that Earth is about 71% covered with water. The other 29% is land and various Islands.
Yeah, I found that out a few years ago, there is so much ocean that hasn’t been explored. Can you imagine what is in there?
I know right! I always wanted to go treasure hunting and get some gold from like sunken ships or something haha. Do you like science fiction by the way?
I think it’s great to learn about. 
Yes I think it’s interesting, one cool thing to is that NASA has a list of space technology words that writers can use so that they are making accurate statements in the movie
That is awesome! I seen something about starship troopers is the only science fiction novel that is used by three of the five branches in the us military.
Yep you’re right! Have you seen the movie? The movie is really violent but I liked it, it’s from the director of Robocop. I can’t believe it’s on the military reading list though
Yeah me either! A judge in 1950’s tried to ban science fiction comics. Get this, because there was a black character! 
Yeah that’s horrible! interesting that the term "robotic" was created by a science fiction author, you’d think that it would have been an actual science term, and this happened back in 1941 haha
I know right! haha, well it was nice talking to you, I’ve got to fix dinner now. Bye! :)
Hi, how are you?
Great! Did you know that Oscar Isaac requested that his character in The Force Awakens be from Yavin 4, because he’s from Guatemala and that’s where the Yavin 4 scenes were shot in the original trilogy?
I did not know that! I was also shocked to learn that George Lucas’s wife won an emmy while he did not.
Huh, he didn’t win an Emmy for the Star War Christmas special? Haha. In 2013 Star Wars was the first film to be dubbed into a Native American language -- Navajo. 
I find it sad that this was not done until 2013. Don’t you think it should have been earlier than that?
You would think. It is sad. For the original Star Wars movie, James Earl jones only got paid $7500 and recorded all of his lines in just 2 and a half hours. Talk about a bargain. 
Yeah! That does work out to a great hourly rate though. The total value of the star wars franchise is $65B!
And that’s after they studio thought it was going to flop, so Lucas gave up his $500k directing fee in return for licensing and merchandising rights. Maybe one of the best business decisions ever made!
Yeah! Do you know what he sold to Disney for? How much???
Seems like it was over a billion. Back to Lucas’s wife -- she had a lot of the best ideas for the original movie, like Obi Wan’s death. 
I cried when I saw that part. Still makes me sad. She also suggested Leia’s good luck kiss...
And re-edited the trench run scene to make it more suspenseful. Those are some big contributions. Much deserving of the editing Oscar. 
I agree. I think star wars is getting too watered down, with average movies like Solo and New Hope. They were ok movies but not up to the quality we have come to know about the franchise.
Totally agree. I did LOVE the spin-off Rogue One though from 2016. That one felt like a true Star Wars movie from back i the day. 
I did like that one. I thought that had a good story and nice acting. There’s a reason why they are the most successful film merchandising franchise!
Definitely. I also like the diversity of the films. Did you know in the 1950’s a judge tried to ban a sci-fi comic because one of the characters was black? Crazy. 
Very unfair. Isn’t (s)he supposed to be just? Weighing the decisions of the land so that everyone is treated fairly?
The 50’s were a different time, unfortunately. One of the first sci-fi stories is thought to be from ancient Greece, over 1800 years ago, about plant-based aliens living on the moon.
Who thinks of these stories? I guess it is more of a commentary on my lack of creativity.
Haha. Isaac Asimov coined the term Robots in 1941. I’d have thought it was much older than that. 
Yeah. That seems young. Nice chatting with you!
hi, did you watch the movie titanic?
Yes, I watched the movie several times and for me it was touching.
Yes it always is. did you know the founder of Hershey was going to be in the ship but had to cancel due to work
No, I didn’t know that, are you aware if or not the titanic was found in real life?
Yeah and there are even picture of the iceberg that sunk the titanic
Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actor, do you have a favorite actor?
I do not think I have a favorite one but he was soo good in the titanic
If you had to bucket list, what will be number on your bucket list?
travel the world and explore as many countries as possible . and you?
About the same travel the world, visit places that I have never visit before, no matter how far.
yeah that would be incredible. d o you like dogs?
Yes, I like dogs, I have a german shepard, but I also will like to have a husky if I live in the mountains.
That is really nice. they can have one of the 12 types of blood
Do you have a dog, If yes what breed of dog and his name?
I do not unfortunately for now. Maybe later. Dogs can also donate blood that is so cool
Wow, that is cool, do you know any of your personal friend’s dog that donated blood?
No, none that I know. In Istanbul they have vendin machines that dispense food and water for dogs
Ok, do you like horse, If you do, have you rode a horse before?
I have ridden a horse before and they are my favorite animals. How about you?
Yes, I rod a once, I was raised on a farm and all my friends had a horse except me.
THey are such gentle creatures. Nice chatting with you.
Do you watch the Red Sox? 
I do, what do you think about Prices injury?
It sucks that he is injured, a friend of mine had the same problem from typing on the computer.
Yeah I guess carpal tunnel is a pretty common injury, it seems like his problem is related to gaming
Yeah, I guess that is better than Tommy John problems. 
Well the team manager must be really mad, after all David is one of the key pieces of the team, he said his been playing for a while now, since he was 12 so I wonder if playing games is really the cause
Yeah, he is a great player. Did you know video games were orignally used by the military? 
No I didnt, I always thought they were used for entertainment although I know the millitary use them currently
I know, it was probably for some type of war game. 
What are your thoughts on the name ’’Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Devices’’ ?
I play them every now and then. LOL
I think its a really long and boring name lol, I do like to play video games as well do you have a PlayStation system?
No, I used to though. I didn’t like the games that were coming out on it. 
I see well I bought one and used to play fifa 14, that was the last game that came our for the PlayStation 2 model.
I used to play that too. Did you Tom Hanks brother does woody’s voice in video games? 
I didnt, he has a great voice! you know that Stephen Fry is also a game narrator, he narrater the voice for some games
Yeah, I heard that. Apparently playstation 3s are being used to research blackholes. 
Wow it sounds like the consol has a lot of power, it must be cheaper than building a computer capable of doing that, the department of defense also used them to build a supercomputer, in fact 1760 units
yeah, apparently they used them to build a super computer, I wonder if they were actually playing grand theft auto!
I dont about that but something funny happened to the company, they issued and unlock code for the ps3 by accident, they were prosecuting people that did the same things before them.
Wow, did you ever try any of the baseball games on playstation?
I did, but I rather watch the games than to play them on a video game console, do you like baseball?
Yeah, me too. I like baseball a lot, I played when I was younger. 
Hello! How are you today?
Hello, I’m great thanks for asking. Do you like video games?
I do! I’ve been playing for over 20 years now, how about you?
I have been playing for about 25 years now. I saw video games were originally called cathode ray tube amusement devices.
Say that ten times fast haha. Did you know it is illegal for kids 16 and under to play video games past midnight?
Haha. I did not know that, but maybe that’s a good idea. 
I agree. Do you have a playstation or xbox?
I have a PS4. What about you?
I have an xbox. I wonder when the playstation came out?
I love Sony so I’ve always stuck with Playstation.
I had the playstation and playstation 2 but then jumped to xbox. I think it’s cool the military uses playstation 3’s to build a supercomputer.
That is very cool. They are super powerful devices so it makes sense to me.
Do you like to watch baseball at all?
I love baseball. What about you?
Same here. I didn’t know it was more popular in Japan than it is here!
Me either. It’s a huge past time here in America. I’m excited for opening day.
Who do you like to watch?
I love the Cincinnati Reds. What about you?
I’m not a fan of a team but like watching it in general! Anyways, Great chatting with you!
I think the same. It was good talking to you too!
Have a great day!
Hello. Do you play any video games?
I do play games.  I enjoy the call of duty game series.
I also enjoy that game. Did you know video games were initially called cathode ray tube amusement devices and were used by the military?
Yes, cathode ray tubes have come and gone and the game plays on.  I have a Playstation 3, but no plans to upgrade.  
I have a ps3 as well. I dont see the point to buying a ps4. This one is all I need as well.
The game Destiny turned me off gaming.  It was fun to play, but it demands network connectivity.  Sometimes the old games are just fun.  Donkey Kong and Mario are still OK.  I see Fifa 14 works on PS2, PS3 and PS4.
I was never into soccer games. I liked Madden though. Did you know that ps3s are being used to research black holes.
Yes, people let them run and they network together.  Sort of like the 1760 PS3’s used by the department of defense to make a super computer.  Never tried Madden.
Never played madden. You will have to try it. How about grand theft auto. Have you played that one?
I do indeed love GTA.  I want to say that I played early rev levels on a PC.  It was a different game back then. FUDGE RIPPLE!  I will search for a disk and see if it is audio.
THe original game when played in a cd player would play the soundtrack to the game.
Interesting.  Have you ever had carpel tunnel syndrome brought on by playing games?
Actually I have. I dont know if that is why I got it though. I was typing a lot for work when I got it.
Yes, it can be a big deal.  Imagine a Major League Baseball player missing games because of carpel tunnel.  LOL.
I can imagine it. It really is painful. Did you know that baseball managers wear a uniform because they are allowed to play if needed?
Haha.  Imagine if your boss could sit in for you at work.  He would be steamed if you said, "I have a Fortnite related injury and must sit this out." 
He would be steamed and I would be totally embarrassed. Lol. Did you ever play soccer baseball. That’s what Canadians call kickball.
Kickball on the playground. What fun.  David Price is the MLB player with a 217 million dollar seven year contract.  Cant play ball games.  Perhaps because of video games. He might try kick ball.
Maybe he should. What did you think about that guy findin 3 million dollars worth of old baseball cards in his grandpas attic.
Finding 3 million dollars worth is like finding an unlock code for life.
It wouldn’t guarantee you win the game but it would sure make it a lot easier. Lol. Have a great day. 
Have a good day.
hey there do you watch any shows on Netflix
Yes I have a subscription, been watching The Office.  They have come out with their own originals too called Netflix Original.  What about you?
oh ya I love stranger things and other shows they have, I do the digital though not with dvds
Oh no I don’t do DVDs either just the streaming service.  It’s too bad it doesn’t have Game of Thrones though, that show has gotten 37 emmy awards.
I do like GOT! George RR Martin is the author and a genius!
It is such a hit parents are naming their kids Arya.  Only a couple more months until the last season starts.
ya I can’t wait, weird that charlie Chaplins granddaughter is in the show too!
Wonder if they ever offered Tom Cruise a part, he has won so many awards for best actor, they probably can’t afford him.
ya, he is a great actor though, so many classic roles like Maverick in Top gun and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July
Yeah I really like him in The Last Samurai.  He spend time learning Japanese and swordplay on this own to prepare for the role.  Good on him.
yup I like that movie, I never realized samurai was plural and refers to the whole group and not just Tom Cruise haha
I liked him in Rainman too, that movie won Best Picture.  I think one of my favorites is when he plays a hitman in Collateral with Jamie Foxx.
oh ya that is a really good movie, he is kind of looney though he spent 10 million dollars to build a bunker to protect himself from aliens
Yeah I think he is into Scientology. Did you know he was married to Nicole Kidman? They have since divorced.  Though they did so Eyes Wide Shut together.
lol, that is a weird movie though, Seinfeld is super rich though, richer than Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise combined apparently 
Well I am just glad I do not have any stock in MoviePass.  It fell to under a dollar after people found out Christopher Robin was not being shown last summer.
oh wow ya I’m glad I didn’t get that, I just use Netflix and thats enough for me
Netflix is piling up debt to fund all these new series and shows, 21.9 billion at last count.  But they have made 125+ shows and series of new content.
ah I didn’t know that, they sure take up a lot of bandwidth, about 1/3 of all internet traffic
I bet Blockbuster regrets not buying them for 50 million.  Now they are out of business or pretty close.
ya, with Netflix now worth about 2 billion, that was definitely a mistake!
Hello, are you a big Netflix person?
I am!  I have been a subscriber for years and especially love the original content!
I do as well! Were you a subscriber even back when their whole business model was about DVD rental by mail and not an online platform?
I was! I think it was in 2007 when they started adding streaming features.
It’s interesting to think how differently the company could have been if decisions played out differently. Like Blockbuster declining to buy them many times, and now they’re worth many times over.
Exactly! A purchase of $50 million that is now worth $2 billion. That is just CRAZY!
And I feel like that doesn’t even big to desribe how huge Netflix is still. Netflix accounts for a third of ALL bandwith in North America from 9pm to 12 am!
Which is honestly just nuts. And when you combine Netflix and youtube, it’s half of the peak internet traffic in North America alone!
I was surprised to learn recently though, that despite how huge their online platform is, they still do DVD rentals! And spend 20 times more on postage than their bandwith.
True - but I think they might need to start paying more attention to what they are spending - they racked up $21.9 billion in debt as of Sept 2017 trying to get content!
That’s certainly a lot of money! Although at least it’s an investment and will come back to them. On the other hand, I remember a decade ago, Tom Cruise spent $10 million on an underground bunker to protect himself from aliens, what a nut.
I stopped liking him when he went all about Scientology. I much prefer other actors now, like Peter Dinklage.
I’ve never heard of him, does he do a lot of action movies? I like Tom Cruise because of movies like Top Gun and Cocktail but I’m always interested in expanding my preferences.
Actually, Peter Dinklage plays Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones! 
Oh wow! That’s a beautiful show I’ve been meaning to watch, it’s filmed in Ireland I think! And from the limited parts I’ve seen the scenery is gorgeous.
Yes. It is my most favorite show - which it definitely has earned with all of its Emmys - 47 to be exact! 
That’s a whole lot! They’re certainly influential, I read somewhere that Arya is the fastest rising baby name for girls in the US, due to a character from the Game of Thrones.
My daughter is named Arya. So we definitely fell into the trend! I am sad it is going to end this year, with the last season starting in April.
Oh wow that’s very cool! Hey at least if you ever want to pick up a new show after, Nat Geo Wild has a show that parodies Game of Thrones but follows lions!
I heard about that! I think that would be awesome - following them like the characters in the show!
Yeah absolutely, regardless it will be cool to see if Netflix can makea similar show themselves after Game of Thrones ends. Anyways it was nice chatting with you, have a good day!
Hello, do you watch Netflix?
Hi there, I do sometimes, but don’t have an account myself.  How about you?
I do have an account. Did you know from 9pm-12am, Netflix accounts for 33% of all the bandwidth in North America?
Holy cow, that is so much bandwidth during those peak hours. 
I agree. Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.
That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future. 
Netflix is worth $2 billion right now.
Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it’s online service, they laughed at the offer. 
I bet lol. Netflix was started due to a $40 late fee incurred by Reed Hastings.
Yeah old Reed didn’t like those late fees, look what happened since then. 
Do you like Tom Cruise?
Yeah I do, I really like 80’s Tom Cruise movies.  How about you?
Me too. I love Top Gun.
Yeah Top Gun was one of his best for sure, I always like risky business. 
Tom Cruise once threatened Tom Kruse who is the inventory of the hoverboard.
I heard that!  I think he should have just endorsed it and gone along with it.
I agree. Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and swordplay in preparation for a film.
That is dedication, I have always admired him for his acting skills. 
Me too. He has a $10 million dollar underground bunker to protect himself from aliens.
That is the weird side of him, I remember when he went kind of nuts on the Ellen show years back. 
It was great chatting.
Did you know the china wall was very large and famous in the world.
I did know that. I think I saw a movie about that on Netflix actually. Do you have Netflix
Yes, i have Netflix. Netflix was founded in 1997.
Yep it’s crazy that they’re going to spend it 2 billion dollars this year to make more new content. I do like their shows though
Netflix tv shows are awesome. And Netflix founder was reed hastings and marc.
Yep he started it because he was mad about the late fee for his movie Apollo 13 haha that is actually really good movie have you ever seen it
I saw that movie. I think the movie was released in 1970.
I think it was actually in the nineties I think you’re thinking of the wrong one haha. Apollo 13 head Tom Hanks in it. What do you think about Tom Cruise though
I love tom cruise and his movies. It was awesome. mission impossible movie was so great.
Yep I like Mission Impossible II. I also like The Color of Money in the movie Cocktail. Eyes Wide Shut was pretty weird though haha
tom cruise edge of tomorrow movie was awesome. edge of tomorrow directer has a great mind.
It’s crazy that Tom Cruise spent two years learning Japanese and how to use a samurai sword to prepare for the movie The Last Samurai. Personally I didn’t really like that movie what did you think
Tom cruise was great actor and hard worker. He spend a lot of to learn a japanese language.
Yeah for sure. I also never knew that in the movie, The Last Samurai, Samurai is actually plural and refers to Tom Cruise and the whole clan
I think the movie was released in 2003 and the movie was successfully crossed 45-68 crores usd.
I always think the Tom Cruise is super rich, but Seinfeld has a net worth that is more than Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks combined which is insane
Tom hanks also great actor and his net work is $390 million.
He has a great actor. Tom Cruise is kind of a weird guy though. He spent $10 on a bunker to protect himself from outer space aliens
It’s great but i don’t know.
Do you ever watch Game of Thrones? I love that show, it has won a bunch of awards
I watch all 7 seasons. it’s all are good.
Yeah I love them. And I didn’t know that Arya is the fastest growing baby girl name in the United States period that is definitely due to Game of Thrones
good morning to you
Good morning! Are a fan of The Simpsons? Fox News once tried to sue to get the show to stop parodying them. 
I love the Simpsons! not so much Fox news though, they deserve to parodied
They practically ARE a parody! Do you remember their version of the Daily show from 2007? Man, it was terrible. Really, really terrible. It was canceled after 13 episodes. 
with Jon Stewart? the one on Comedy Central?
Yeah, fox tried to copy it with their own show called the Half Hour News Hour. 
oh I thought you were saying The Daily Show was bad and got cancelled! yea Fox should not have copied that show. Did you know Fox News and IGN are owned by the same company?
I did not know that. But I’m sure Rupert Murdoch owns dozens of companies I don’t know about. Another thing I didn’t know -- Hillary Clinton was the president of the You ng Republicans in college. 
wow! her views sure have shifted a lot since then, huh/
I’d say. Nixon actually proposed a guaranteed minimum wage, the only president to ever do so. 
which surprises me , I always thought that that was something that pretty much everyone had touched upon in their time in office at least a little bit
Yeah, I was surprised too. Another surprising fact: Tea Party/GOP poster child Ayn Rand was on Social Security and Medicare. 
wow. I never cared for her books, did you?
No. Couldn’t even finish the one I started. Canada’s first official currency was playing cards! Now that’s cool. 
sometimes i wish they still used stuff like that! id be rich! haha
Haha. Hawaii passed single payer healthcare in 2009, but the governor wouldn’t sign it into law. If only the rest of the country would follow suit - and then pass it into law. 
yea I wish we had single payer, my health insurance is so complicated sometimes. people shouldnt go broke over a doctor visit
Totally agree. It’s ridiculous that we don’t haver it in this country. Someday, I think. Hopefully. 
Some candidates are pushing for it! sadly those guys dont win office
Yeah. In Kentucky, you can’t take office if you’ve ever participated in a duel. Maybe that’s what we need more of in politics today -- duels. 
imagine that? haha duels in court would be hilarious 
Do you like Taylor Swift?
I liked her country stuff and some of her earlier pop. How about you?
I do like her, specially her performance of the Reputation tour she had in Glendale. AZ
It seems like she and Kanye West have perpetual conflicts of one sort or the other.  First he crashed her award acceptance.  Then she is accused of stealing his music.  Social media was not kind to her over that accusation!
I think they were a bit unfair to her, it must be hard to be a celebrity, specially a really famous one like her
Well, they called her a "snake".  I like the way she turned it into a positive in her concert with imagery, a snake microphone, and a snake platform.  Snakes in general have an unwarranted bad reputation.  Do you have any experience with snakes?
No not really, but I love them many people are scared of them but I think they are interesting animals
I live in a rural area, so snakes are not uncommon.  I have a 4-5 foot common garter snake nesting at the base of my fig trees.  I like there because she eats the field mice and other critters who want my figs.  Too many people automatically assume snakes are poisonous.  Did you know that only in Australia do venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous ones?
I didnt know that about Australia, are you afraid of snakes? with what you told me previously I bet you are not afraid of them
No.  I let them go on their way and I go one mine.  While we do have coral snakes, water moccasins, rattle snakes, I have never been bitten.  Did you know that one man has been bitten so often that the antigens in his blood allow it to be used an anti-venom?
Really? I guess he made a valuable contribution to science and also to medicine, did you hear of that species of flying snakes
I had not, but I could see it possible to approximate flying.  I know they can climb trees because I see the garter snake in my fig trees.  I guess if she wanted to, she could coil and spring, flinging herself from one tree to another.  Down here, Mardi Gras ended last night.   My ears are still ringing from the concerts put on by local bands.  Did you know that a Fighter Concert was so loud that it was picked up on New Zealand seismic (earthquake) monitors?
I didnt know that, do you have any favorite bands? used to like Linking Park
When I lived in Viginia, I liked Dave Matthews when he was starting out in Charlottesville.  Did you know that a woman driving to a Dave Matthews concert picked up a stranded bicyclist who was Dave Matthews himself!
Wow, that is amazing, I mean what are the ods, that woman is really lucky, I bet she went crazy in that moment.
I would think so.  I have not been to an major act indoor concert since my high school and college days in the 1970s and the 1980s.  Back then Deep Purple broke the record for the loudest concert ever that rendered 3 people unconscious.  While rendering 3 people unconscious is alarming, I wonder how many people had lifelong hearing damage after that one?
I bet at least a few of them did, a really bad concert was the one the band Creed gave in 2002, the concert was so bad the band even got sued by some of the concert goers
Well, Creed survived that one to become a major rock act in the early 2000s.  Do you know if Taylor Swift is still on the "Reputation" concert tour or has that wrapped up?
I guess its all wrapped up by now, I think this article is a bit old, I think that tour happened around 2016 so yeah.
I glad her reputation survived from the Kanye West feud.  While I not much of a fan of her current music, she is a talented artist.  She also is quite a philanthropist.  Did you know she donated all proceeds from "Wildest Dream" song to African wildlife conservation?
No, I didn’t know about that, seems like she has a great great, I will follow her example from now on, anyways it’s been cool to chat, thanks for all the facts and knowledge
Well, its time to start cycling to work.  Nice chatting with you.
That will do some favors to the enviroment for sure, nice chatting, have a nice day. 
Do you like snakes?
they are kind of gross to me, but do you like them?
Yeah there history is strange. Apparently there is a lizard with no legs and i always though that was what a snake was, lol. 
really? I wonder what separates the two from each other then, i have to imagine they look very similar
You would think but that’s not what they pay me for, ha. Maybe we should move to new zealand they don’t have snakes there.
i agree, snakes are so creepy, they are a very lucky country in my opinion
Mine too. Apparently fear of snakes is hard wired into our brains and monkeys.
maybe it is because of the way that they move or the noises that they make? I cannot think of why that may be the case
Me either. Do you know who Taylor Swift is? 
I do, I am a big fan of her music!
she was born on December 13 1989. one of her albums won 4 grammy’s. 
she is very successful, she also owns a private jet, she is doing very well for herself
Yes she is and to be so young it’s great! that jet is a Falcon 900 and cost 40 million right? Those are really nice.
yes, that is more than I will see in my lifetime, but I am glad she was able to make so much in her career before she loses popularity
Well hopefully she did well with the money she made so far because fame don’t last forever. 
that is true, she knows her stuff, she took her music off spotify so it was not free, she is kind of money minded
Well that’s good. Apparently she accidentally released 8 seconds of white noise and topped Canadian itunes charts, lol.
that is insane, just imagine being that popular, most people never even see that much success
Right! Her walking backward to avoid picture taking is a ;little weird though. 
i guess i sort of get that, it must be annoying being public so often
I can’t even imagine. Nice chatting with you!
Where do you source your news? Fox, Cnn, other?
Mostly other. Certainly not Fox. 
Did you know that CNN recently raised concern about Fox & Friends?
I had heard something about it. Weren’t they concerned about their interviews with Republicans?
Yes you are correct. Despite the students mourning due to a mass shooting a day earlier, Republicans appeared only a fox where they wouldn’t be pressed about gun control
That’s terrible. All of our press should be able to question our representatives. I think some of the people they interviewed were Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz if I remember correctly. 
All they mentioned was that it was a truly heart breaking horror and that evil is sadly always present.
We should have known it’s bias since it was created by a Republican media strategist and Richard Nixon. 
I feel that most news are bias in some way or another. Too bad fox is watched more than cnn and msnbc combined.
That’s sad. Apparently they even threatened to sue the Simpsons for making fun of them for their anti-democratic agenda. They wanted to stop them from continuing that. 
I mean usually its kind of funny how they threatened to sue the Simpsons over a fact which is true. I guess their perspective is a given since they were created by Richard ailes and president Richard nixon.
I agree. They would never win because of parody laws anyway. Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a Republican?! How odd. 
It seems like a strange coincidence? 
Ha ha. Maybe. Unsurprisingly, there has not been a president that was not a democrat or republican since 1853. 
Well I believe either Roosevelt or JFK came very close as a uncorrelated 3rd party.
You may be correct. I was floored to learn that the last time until very recently that a Republican president was elected without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was 1928!
Wow! I didn’t know the extent to which the Nixons and Bushs were so influential. I also recently found out that the colors of red and blue associated with republicans and democrats was a recent change, only starting in 2000. I wonder if they used any other colors before then?
That is a good question. I would have thought it had been that way for a longer time period than that. Did you know that Truman visited Disneyland and would not be photographed on the Dumbo ride so he wasn’t associated with Republicans. 
Well for politicians image is everything. At least at some level of politics, the US has been quite progressive. For instance, Texas’ first elected female governor came into office even before some states ratified the 19th amendment
Wow, I would not have thought that, especially with it being such a conservative state. I was sad when I learned that only one governor was against the internment of Japanese citizens during WWII. 
I understand the difficulties of a country given it is a melting pot and it can’t let spies cause problems in WWII due to conflicting loyalties, but they didn’t execute this process well and treated Americans of Japanese heritage unfairly. It is too bad only 1 governor was against their imprisonment. 
I agree. What a horrible blight on our history.
Did you know that the Beatles song Come Together was written for Timothy Leary? 
No I did not, but it wouldn’t surprise me since Leary’s research was about the use of psychedelic drugs.
Yeah, I remember that, he was pretty out there, right? 
Yeah, he wrote about every drug under the sun haha. Although, a lot of recent evidence has proven some of his theories correct
Like which ones? I’m not familiar with a lot of them. 
I think like ecstasy, mushrooms, and LSD, pretty much a lot of the stuff that the government bans.
OMG, I read about that. Did you know that in 1934 North Dakota’s governor declared martial law? 
That’s crazy, do you know for what exactly?
I’m not sure. But I know that texas elected their first female governor before some states even ratified the 19th amendment. 
Yeah, and it’s crazy that Texas used to be a blue state until the 1980s, then it turned very red haha
Interesting, like the ground turned red? Or you mean politics? 
No, like in politics. It used to be mostly democratic. More interestingly, the "blue" and "red" colors tow denote the two parties weren’t legitimately used until 2000. 
Oh, so like a long time ago Democrats were pro slavery I think. Wasn’t Honest Abe a republican? 
Yeah, he was. The parties have flip flopped so much throughout US history. But on a lighter note, every president who has had a beard has been Republican, which is really crazy.
I’m not sure if that is true, sadly I don’t know a lot about politics, so I can’t call that out if it is wrong. 
I’m somewhat interested in politics but they just make me depressed.
Nah, I think it is at its best now. Most entertainment in years. 
Haha that’s so true
You know there hasn’t been a US president who hasn’t been a republican or democrat since 1853, who was it? 
I think they were in the Whig Party. But I don’t the president. Tyler maybe?
Do you own a pet snake?
No but there are some snakes outside around where I live at.
They are considered legless lizards. I like lizards but not snakes
What is your favorite type of lizard?
Iguana by far. I almost bought a baby one yesterday. I was looking at Chameleons too
Would you ever consider owning a larger one like a crocodile?
Heck no. They are illegal too, aren’t they?
Oh I didn’t realize they were illegal to own.
They are more closely related to birds and I only like parrots for birds, and the bald eagle of course
Do you like Taylor Swift?
I do, kinda. I like her as a person. She seems humble and very likeable
Yea, she also walks backwards around paparazzi.
She was born and raised close to where I grew up in Pennslyvania too
Do you know about the Tennessee state?
Not too much. How about you?
Yes, I know more than most would about the state. There are some big snakes there.
What kind of snakes are common to Tennessee? Rattlers? Bull snakes?
I think it’s them rattlers!
I had a bull snake in my yard last year, a big one too.
What happened?
I let him be and just watched him slither through my backyard
Was it a big one?
It appeared as so to me. I stayed far away from him because of how big he was.
Did you ever about them snake whistling people?
I don’t understand the question.
Hi!  Do you watch the news?
Yes I love watching the news. How about you?
I love the information, but everything these days is so slanted from both sides sometimes it is hard to get.
Right there is not one source out there that you can trust. I hate the news outlets, but still need to see what’s going on.
Much agreed.  I find that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  The media tries to create outrage for their ratings.
Exactly. That’s why I watch both CNN and Fox. It kind of helps me to sort through the muck.
Fox is watched more than Cnn and MSNBC combined.  Kinda crazy to think that.
I think Fox is slightly more honest than the other two.
Fox news threatened to sue the simpsons over their constant parody.
I didn’t know that. I don’t watch the Simpsons. I know CNN is whining because they can’t get any conservative guests. Why would you want to go on their show and be abused.
Why would a liberal news network want a conservative guest?
I think so that they can attempt to make them look like a liar or a fool or whatever negative thing they can think of.
That is true. Did you hear about that time in 1957 when Truman refused to be photographed with Dumbo
No I didn’t. That’s funny. Maybe Dumbo wasn’t crazy about the idea either.
Yeah.  Maybe they should have brought Eeyore out
Okay you’ve got me there, who’s Eeyore.
He is the Donkey from winnie the pooh.
Okay now I understand. He’d make a good mascot for the Demos.
Definitely.  Did you know the red and blue colors started being used in 2000?
No I had no idea. Did you know that every president with a beard has been a Republican?
I heard that.  I wonder how many presidents had beards, I know lincoln, but who else?
I can’t think of any. I can’t imagine someone getting elected today who even has a mustache.
Very true.  Haha.  Great chat!
Good morning! Do you know anything about snakes? I saw a huge one on reddit the other day!
I know that they are elongated and legless reptiles covered in scales. Furthermore, they have highly mobile jaws and usually fangs for venom.
That’s true. My husband pulled one out of my garden. I had never seen it before. It’s a rat snake. I guess they are good for killing pests.
I think rat snakes aren’t poisonous? Did you know that the fear of snakes are wired into human brains? I guess people who hate snakes should live in new Zealand since there aren’t any there.
Nope, rat snakes aren’t poisonous. They are actually a good kind. I have always believed no snakes should exist, so I believe we are wired for it!
I wonder what differentiates snakes from legless lizards?
That is a good question. Maybe that lizards have eyelids and some snakes dont. 
That makes sense. Personally, I don’t mind snakes, although I am wary since venom can be quite potent and dangerous. As long as they aren’t flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey are around my area and I can spot them well a head of time, I’m okay.
flying snakes? My worst nightmare!!
I guess New Zealand would be ideal for you, with no snakes and all
True! Do you ever Listen to Taylor Swift?
I have heard bits hear and there and recently read some articles, but I am not completely familiar.
She writes a lot of her music about herself. Very popular singer. Who do you listen to?
Well I do know Kanye did a self mocking skit 2 years before the infamous Taylor swift incident. Other than that, she is among the worlds contemporary artists.
And she owns a private jet!
I recently learn she once accidentally released several seconds of white noise and it somehow topped the Canadian itunes chart.
That is funny! But she also thinks music should not be free. I disagree there. I should be able to listen to it all I want.
Well for artists, royalties are a lot part of their revenue, even for moderate artists.
Thats true I suppose. Do you know Swift walks backwards so she wont have her pic taken?
Wouldn’t walking backwards make her stick out more?
I would think. Do you listen to Linkin park at all? they played 324 concerts in 2001.
Unfortunately, I have never listened to Linkin park. However, I have listened to The Ramones and they played a total of 2,263 concerts.
Wow! I was always a big Pink Floyd fan myself. They played in an empty roman amphitheater once. 
Were they recording a music video? Or did they just do it for fun? A ancient roman amphitheater sounds amazing
I think they did a video there. Thats why there was no audience! The ramones did a lot of concerts. How long did they tour?
I believe they toured for 20 years!. Anyway I think I will check out Linkin park. Thank you for the chat.
Do you watch the news?
A few times a day.  
Me too, what do you think about Fox news? Apparently they are watched more than msnbc and cnn combined.
They are biased and pro republicans. It is okay though.  Free speech is always good.
Yeah your right. Fox was created by republican media strategist and a former president. 
Richard Allies and former President Nixon created the fox news.
The Two Richards that’s right..haha!
Yes,it was funny.  Do you know that Foxnews tried to sue the Simpsons?
I heard they were trying to silence a parody of anti-democratic party agenda.
Yes, you are right.  They want it to stop the Simpsons from parodying its anti democratic party agenda.
They also discussed creating a channel that would only play the Simpsons.
Yes, I heard about it.
Not sure what they hoped to accomplish since the Simpson’s were never going to stop clowning them. 
They own the Simpsons, right?  Why were they against them since the simpsons have been generating money for them for years?
Good question! They also owe IGN the gaming website. Do you game?
No I do not but I’m aware of the fact.
Ok. On a different note did you know that when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor he did not live in Sacramento but instead commuted everyday by jet for three hours?
I did not know that.  Do you know that the republican party is also referred to as GOP.  Arnold is a republican.
Yup! Speaking of governors, did you know that Ralph Lawrence Carr was the only one to opposed Japanese American interment camps during WW2.
I heard about it.  Good for him.  Those Japanese people were American.
They were, so sad. Texas elected it’s first female governor. 
She was the second female governor in the US.
Your right, nice chatting with you. 
Hello, do you ever watch Fox News?
I usually don’t watch it. I understand that it’s popular.
Fox discussed the possibility of creating a cable channel that would only air the Simpsons.
That is an idea that might work, but now I figure people are on the Internet. Maybe a YouTube channel?
Possibly...The gaming website IGN is actually owned by Fox News.
Oh, I didn’t know that. I guess Fox owns a lot of things out there. A gaming site? Hm.
Yea very interesting. Fox News is watched more than CNN and MSNBC combined.
I believe it. CNN has its own bias, as does MSNBC. People watch what they want to believe.
Yep, not a huge fan of CNN because they post so much fake news and are very biased.
I don’t watch CNN. What kind of fake news?
They just report things that are fake or swayed to the liberal spectrum of politics. Fox News was created by Richard Ailes and Richard Nixon.
The viewership of Fox skews pretty old. In 2015, the median viewer age was 68 years old. Older people tend to be more conservative.
That is very old. Did you know there hasn’t been a president who wasn’t a rep or dem since 1853?
The two party system is frustrating because the choices are limited. The money backs certainly candidates, and there is little possibility for outsiders to get in.
I agree. Every president with a beard has always been a republican.
I guess that imparts a look of sage wisdom and manliness.  
I guess so lol. The last time a republican was elected president without a Nixon or Bush on the ticket was back in 1928.
That’s quite a while. I guess Trump might be starting a new dynasty. Will his daughter run? Who knows.
Haha possibly. Who knows what will happen next.
I would like to see some change in gov’t. Sometimes old ideas have value. The only president to propose a guaranteed minimum income was a republican, Nixon.. I think that people are worried now and would like some security.
Me too. It was good talking to you.
Are you familiar with Native American books?
I read a few in school.  I was raised in Oklahoma and many of my friends were of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.  I have heard of Tommy Orange’s fiction novel about Native Americans.
That’s interesting!  He is a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.  I don’t know much about those two tribes.  His book is about a boy?
Yes.  It is fiction however.  It provides insight into the challenges that the boy has in grappling with his identity.  We have a national history where many atrocities and slurs dot the history.
True!  I went to an indian reservation this past summer in New York.  It was the Seneca nation and I went through one of their museums.  They pretty much got kicked out of their land just like all the other tribes in the nation.
A people divided into tribes cannot stand against a unified enemy.  But, my wife’s best friend has a Ph.D. and the government paid for all of her education because she is Cherokee.  But if one knows the facts, a lot of interesting history can be written.
Wow.  That’s really interesting.  Hopefully Tommy Orange’s book does well.  
Books can be fiction with a lot of facts or not so many.  Wiki has an article where they rank fictional characters according to their powers.
Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction in his youth.  Never knew that he did that before.
I wonder how one would find a copy of it.  Imagine Edgar Allen Poe wrote about a cyborg a long time ago
Interesting!  A judget ried to ban a science fiction comic in the 1950’s because it featured a black character. 
Wow!  We have come a long way, thank goodness.  The FDA also burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.
I think I remember reading about that before.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I would like to see one of those gold medals.
I would like to understand the scoring.  I bet it was somewhat like Jeopardy.  I would also like to read the "best" of the "worst opening sentences" that people used to enter into a contest.
lol  That would be interesting.  Didn’t Sir Winston Churchill win a nobel prize for literature?
That would not be my first guess, but I think you are right!   Based on literature, kissing is a fairly recent development.
You would think that would have been written about a long time ago.  Switching gears ... id you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?
People did not wear brands on clothing so prominently as they do today back in 1986.  So that was Apple being innovative in another field.
Surprisingly, the Pilgrims wore clothing that was full of color and they only wore black for special occasions.  I’m so used to seeing them stereotyped wearing black and white.
Me too.  You know that every human society has worn clothes.
I would hope so.  lol  I guess it depends on your body type, etc.
I suppose if the weather is perfect, a grass skirt might be enough, but it is still clothing.  Clothing is often gender specific.  Nice talking.
Are you a fan of books?  I personally read a lot, mostly non-fiction though.
I don’t really have time to read but when I do I like to read fiction. I find it funny that Julius Caesar wrote fan fiction of Greek mythology.
That is sort of odd.  There is even a wiki that ranks fictional characters by their powers, that would be an interesting read.
And in Greek literature there wasn’t much kissing. Romantic kissing is actually a recent development.
That surprises me, I  guess I always associated it with all love stories.  Even Shakespeare.
Yeah I think there was a lot of romance just kissing wasn’t part of it.
I see.  Winston Churchill won a Nobel Prize, for literature.  I always though it was for peace
Interesting! Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952. I always associate the olympics with sports!
Same here, I always thought it was part of the ancient games but never made its way to the modern games.  How do you even judge that?
Yeah, pretty subjective. Speaking of literature contests, there isone that challenges writers to come up with the worst opening sentence for a novel.
I heard there was, I wonder what the winners were, those would be fun to read.
Do you think that literature should be censored?
Absolutely not!  That is why I hated to hear that the FDA burned 6 tons of literature
But should fan fiction be allowed? George RR Martin says it is copyright infringement and isn’t useful for aspiring writers.
i think so.  I think it is a great creative outlet for pepole.
Have you heard of Tommy Orange’s debut novel, There There?
i havenr, whats is it like?
It is about Native Americans in modern history but seems to also touch on how they were treated in the past. It’s a fictional story with elements of truth.
I think that might be an interesting read.
The story follows around different members of a large cast of Native Americans who live in Oakland, CA. I’m not sure if I would like it because I like books that focus on one character.
I can take several focuses as long as I can put together what is going on.
That’s good! Some of the people speak directly to us and others use the third person, so there are diverse approaches. 
It has been good chatting tonight, but my dinner is ready, and I must go.  I have a great night.
Have a good night.
I’ve been reading a lot of interesting stories these past few days.
Really? what have you been reading lately?
A few different fiction stories, very interesting. One was Tommy Orange’s debut novel.
I heard about that one, its the one with the little native american boy right?
Yes! It was quite an emotional read. It made me really think about how life is like for them.
Native Americans suffered for a lot of years, its a story that involves a lot of blood and tears and not an easy story to tell
Definitely! Orange did a great job w how he shared their history... It was quite diff from the 2nd book I read. A Visit From The Goon Squad, familiar?
I heard that book was pretty good as well, kind of dark though, 
For sure, there were some powerful tales. I found the sory about the man born with fetal alcohol syndrome the darkest. You?
I felt sorry about him as well, his mother is in jail so what kind of life can he even have, did you hear about the overweight joung man, 
Yeah, that one was crazy, he had a lot against him. Kinda sad. It all stayed w me for awhile. Had to take a break from the book.
I agree, so do you like fiction? 
I enjoy both fiction and non, however, I espcially like fiction books that have fact along with some imagination sprinkled in.
I see well did you ever play the Super Smash Bros video game? there is actaully a long fiction piece about the game
Yeah, I’ve played that before, I’m more of a reader though lol. I actually read two of Tommy Orange’s books, he had a lot of characters!
I guess thats a great book, I heard good things about it havent really read it, 
What are you more in to - literature, clothing or gaming?
I like all three of them lol, clothing is also one of my favorite subjects and I also like technology
I hear ya, I’m really into clothing too. Switching it up w textiles and materials. Did you know Apple had a clothing line in 1986?
I didnt, I would buy an Apple tshirt for sure, I wonder why they dont have that clothing line anymore
Yeah same. Also, this was interesting, from 1912 to 1952 architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events. How cool
Really cool indeed, they should be events even now, I wonder why they took them out!
Are you a fan of fictions? 
I am a fan somewhat!  I know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fictino.
I’m not a huge fan to be honest. 
Hhaha I was when I was little more than I am now.  In the 1950’s a judge tried to ban a science fiction comic because it featured a black character.  What a sad sign of the times back then.
Did you know the FDA burned 6 tons of literature in an act of censorship.
I didn’t know that.  There’s a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.
Interesting. Who is the best? 
I don’t know.  We’ll have to go look on wikipedia.  lol  I know someone who was the best one year though in literature and that was in 1953 when Winston Churchill won a nobel prize for literature.
That’s pretty cool. It wasn’t for peace? 
Nope.  Literature was an olympic event from 1912 to 1952.  I wonder how they judged that?
LOL, by who could read the fastest? I have no idea. 
Hmmm.....that I don’t know.  I think it was some girl named ...Anne?
Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986? 
I didn’t know that.  I wonder if any of the pieces are worth money now as collectibles?
I’m not sure. It sounds like a horrible idea though. They should stick to phones. 
lol  Yes.  Did you know that pilgrim clothing was full of color and they only wore black and white for special occasions?
I can believe it. A lot of those photos I thought were for Sundays.
I always seem to remember school portraying them to wear black and white.  Rip Curl makes clothes in North Korea yet the label says Made in China.  I’m not familiar with that brand.  They sound shady to me.
Yeah, that doesn’t seem legit. Well, nice chatting with you. 
It was fun and nice chatting with you as well!
Take it easy!
Dogs or cats!?
Dogs!  100%
I KNEW I LIKED YOU! Google likes dogs too!
Hahaha.  yes,  definitely,  I know a few people who work there and they get to bring their dogs to work!!!!  I wish I could do that. 
what, me too. I wouldn’t get anything done but it would be amazing lol! Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?
I did.  I guess I should get my dog checked for her blood type next time I see the vet.  Do you have a dog?
I will have to, yes, his name is rocky, he is my favorite pet of all time, what is your dogs name?
her name is Yuki, it means snow in Japanese,  she is a white dog lol She is a rescue so we dont know the breed,  shes a mutt. 
aww that is cute, rescue dogs tend to be the best! I want to clone my dog when he passes he is that good. They have cloned cats before, but no thanks to a cat
lol that would be cool if you can clone your dog after they pass!  Ive had a few dogs and its heartbreaking.  I even took like 5 years break in between getting another one because I didnt know if I was ready.  Im not a cat person at all,  they are cute. 
ha i agree with that. In japan there are more pets that kids under 15, that is a lot of pets!
Oh wow.  I hope they aren’t neglected in any way! 
I hope not! Otherwise I am going there to stop it! They should do what boulder does and make it so you don’t own pets but are their guardian
Yessssss!  I think they whole world should do that!  Did you know dogs can learn over a thousand words!  
I did not know that! I know that only dogs and elephants respond to pointing, out of thousands of animals
Also,  if you actually can stop countries from eating dog,  South Korea actually sells dog meat in their street markets!  I saw it when I visited there =( it was horrifying.  Yes,  I did know that elephants and dogs are so smart. 
that is so sad and so wrong. I think I remember there was a US person at the olympics that took dogs to save from being killed, it made me feel happy
Thats amazing!  Did you know dogs have " eureka" moments where they feel happy solving a problem to get a reward?
What can’t dogs do! I know they aren’t color blind like we were taught when young. It was so nice chatting with you, tell yuki hi!
Lol Same to Rocky!  Have a good one. 
will do! bye!
That sure is an interesting way to send off a family member. I guess they didn’t want to falsely memorialize her.
I know, I couldnt ever imagine writing something like that about my family.  I guess I am lucky.  
I feel the same way. I would rather just keep it brief and impersonal if I had hard feelings rather than publicly attack them.
It is said that you shouldn’t speak ill of the dead.  I wouldn’t feel like I needed to have the last word.
On a more enjoyable and lighter topic, do you have any pets? I have a dog.
I don’t.  I am not home very much.  But I do love animals.  I would think of myself as a cat person.
Unfortunately I am allergic to cats so while I enjoy them in small doses, I don’t think I could ever own one.
I always think it would be cool to own an exotic pet, although Id never want a bear like Roosevelt had.  
I think he might be one of the few people who could pull off owning a bear. I would love to have one of the big cats as a pet but those are extremely dangerous as well.
There are actually more tigers living as pets in Asia than in the wild.  I never though people would seriously own them in masses.
I wonder if some of those are rescues and they are technically classified as pets. It would seem like there should be strict regulations to own one.
I agree.  I would be too scared to own something that could seriously eat me in my sleep, or any other time it pleased.
It’s scary enough to think that my own dog probably is strong enough to harm me, let alone one of the top predators in the world.
Dogs do understand pointing, along with elephants.  They are the only two animals who have that instinct.  Id love a baby elephant, but they can get kinda big.
I’ve seen videos online where baby elephants interact with humans in a similar style to puppies. It’s a definite bucket list experience for me!
Same here.  My girlfriend loves baby elephants, Ive tried to find a place we can go to have that experience.  I think it would be so cool, and a great surprise.
In looking some of those places up you want to find a place that is a rescue type facility. Unfortunately there are places that exploit the elephants and do not treat them well.
Definitely, not looking for somewhere they abuse the animals.  We’re both big animal lovers.  I kind of like the philosophy in Boulder, CO where you can’t own pets, but you are their guardian.
For me my pets have always been family. I care for them more than I do some people I know.
Definitely a lot more loyal and loving than people
She’s also a lot more straightforward. She wants food, to be pet, more food, and to play with her ball. No guess work needed there.
Very true.  Pets are pretty easy to please.  
That’s probably why they’re so popular worldwide!
Do you own a dog? 
I do, did you know that dogs were the first species to be domesticated?
No, I didn’t. I bet that is why they call them man’s best friend. 
I guess so. They perform so many roles for humans, like hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, and companionship. I guess there’s a reason why they are called that. They do a lot for humans.
Yeah. Apparently there are 12 different types of blood that a dog may have. 
I didn’t know that. I wonder if they get good prizes at blood drives?
LOL, good question. Google prefers dogs to cats, did you know that? 
I did not know that. Did you know that Istanbul has vending machines with food and water for stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles. I think that’s such a neat idea. 
No, I’ve never been to turkey. Have you been? 
I have many years ago. 
Interesting. How was it? Did you know that dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing? 
It was a beautiful place. I was stationed there for a few months so I didn’t get to see too much. I didn’t know that. I always thought that dogs were color blind, but they’re not they just can’t see as many different colors as humans. 
Yeah, that’s what I’ve heard. The first cloned pet was a cat, did you know that? 
I didn’t know that, would you call that a "copy cat?" haha
Hilarious, well there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living in the wild in Asia. 
That’s crazy, I heard that Theodore Roosevelt had over 20 pets, including a bear and a hyena. 
Yeah, he was a big conservationist. What number president was he?
I believe he was the 26th. Did you know that in Japan there’s more pets than there are children under 15?
No, I didn’t know that. They have a population growth problem it appears. 
It seems that way. I’ve heard that it’s illegal to "own" pets in Boulder, Colorado, but you can be their "guardian." Does that mean you can claim them on your taxes?
Interesting. I know people in Boulder, I’ll have to ask them that. Well nice chatting with you. 
Did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types?
Hello, wow no I didn’t. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city’s stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.
Good idea!  Dogs and elephants are the only animals instinctively understanding pointing.  I wonder where that leaves monkeys?
Good question.  Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans
When they first cloned a cat, they named it copy cat.  Haha
Haha, that’s good stuff there.  It is not legal to "own" pets in boulder, colorado, but you may be their "guardian."
I wonder what the difference is?  Teddy Roosevelt had over 20 pets.  I didn’t know this, but he had a bear (teddy bear).
Wow, that’s an interesting fact.  Check this out. In japan, there are more pets than there are children under 15
wow, that’s a lot of pets. Do they have 1 child laws too?
I’ve heard that.  Are pets also used in their meals?
I don’t know.  The emperor of Japan is a scientist and publishes papers.  He must have a lot of influence in various realms.
Interesting, Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.
And scientist john von neumann could by the age of 6, divide two 8 digit numbers in his head and converse in ancient greek. I wonder how that happens.
Good gracious, what a brainiac.  The world wide web was invented in 1989 by an english scientist working in switzerland for the cern, a european state-funded research organization.
I don’t know how they did it, but scientists at Harvard stored a gif animation of a galloping horse in the dna of bacteria
That’s nuts.  Many scientists have advanced degrees in an area of science and pursue careers in various sectors of the economy such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit environments.
Scientist wasn’t a term until the 19th century
Really?  On another note, Google prefers dogs to cats. their code of conduct specifically states that they are a dog company.
Does that mean they donate more to dogs?
I’m not sure on that.  Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. 
I don’t know how, but there are more tigers living as pets in the US than living wild in Asia.  I didn’t even know you could have one as a pet.  Sounds Dangerous!
Fiction works comes from the imagination.
Yes. I like fiction. There is a wiki that ranks fictional characters according to their powers.
Fun, Julius caesar actually wrote fan fiction of hercules.
That is intriguing. Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg in fiction. Did you hear that?
Great, George rr martin doesn’t like fan fiction at all.
I heard that. He thinks it’s copyright infingement.
Yes he does, Snakes are legless and carnivores.
Ah. Yeah, There is a genus of flying snakes that can launch themselves at prey.
Scary, New zealand doesn’t have any snakes.
That sounds great. There are legless lizards... almost as frightening as snakes.
Yes, some of them have eyelids and ears!
That’s creepy. Makes me want to listen to music. Do you like rap?
Yes, Tupac’s music is in the library of congress.
Wow. You know, Korean rappers invented "compliment battle"? 
Interesting, rap is normally delivered over a beat.
Yes. It’s original meaning was "to lightly strike".  Now it describes quick speech.
Yes, eminem wanted to be a comic book artist.
Intriguing. Did you hear about the judge in Michigan who delivered a ruling againt him? She delivered it by rapping when she ruled.
Funny, the earliest rap was in the west african tradiation.
Oh. Seems reasonable I guess. Did you know that flow is a component of rap?
Yes, flow and delivery.
Good morning.  Do you like snakes?
Not really!  lol  I guess I do as long as they leave me alone.
Same here.  Personally I’d like to live in New Zealand. I hear they don’t have any snakes there.
Nice!  I didn’t know that.  Only 70 percent of the worlds snakes lay eggs.
Seriously?  Then I guess the rest do live births?
Yes.  Boas and some others give live birth.
Well that’s creepy.  It’s as creepy as knowing there are some snakes that can fly.
Yikes!  I don’t want to see those.  Not even in a zoo.  lol  When snakes are born with 2 heads, they fight each other food.  That’s creepy too.  Is that a common thing with snakes?????
i don’t know. That does seem really weird to picture a snake fighting itself.
I know right?  I’m going to have to google it.  A man has been bitten so many times by snakes that his blood is able to be used as antivenom.  I wouldn’t want to be him.
Me either.  They say that our brains are naturally hard wired to be afraid of snakes.
I believe it.  I jump and shout when I see one. lol  Australia is the only continent where ven9omous snakes outnumber the non-venomous ones.
I totally believe that. i’ve seen things about that country on tv.  They seem to have a lot of scary creatures over there.
Those salt water crocs. I wouldn’t want to cross paths with either from there. lol  Some owls keep blind snakes in their nests as helpful associates, reducing the abundance of nest parasites.  How interesting is that?  ...and how do they know they are blind? lol
Wow, that is actually a good question! I don’t know. I do know that oddly enough, crocodiles are more closely related to birds than snakes and lizards.
That’s interesting!  Do you happen to read any fiction at all?
I used to.  I like the older fiction.  Speaking of, cyborgs are a lot older than we think.  Edgar Allen Poe wrote the oldest known example of one in one of his works.
I didn’t know that.  The term robotics was accidentally coined by science fiction author Isaac Asimov in 1941.
I didn’t know that!  So he just accidentally made it up?
I guess so.  lol  Do you know what a drabble is?
i honestly have no idea.
Hi, how are you?
Hi, I’m Good. Have you heard of the book Strange objects? It is going to be a HBO miniseries. Many critics think it it the author’s break through.
I have not heard of the book or the miniseries. I do have HBO and will look for it when it comes out.
That is good. It focuses on how the female characters negatively treat one another. It is unusual because it gives it’s female characters permission to be bad.
Nice. I think I do remember that one now. It’s with Amy Adams I think... I did see Gone Girl, did you see that one?
I didn’t, but I know it is by the same author, Gillian Flynn. The author wrote Sharp Objects because she wanted to explore how women aren’t innately good and was sick of literature’s tendency to portray women as spunky girls or bad girls like tramps and vamps.
lynn’s novels are feminist precisely because they aim a megawatt beam, bright as prison lights, into the dark corners of women’s minds and lives
I think you can really see this in the first line of Sharp Objects, where she write that "I was never a good little girl." Amy Dunne in Gone Girl was the same way.
There’s a wiki which ranks fictional characters according to their powers and abilities.
That is interesting. I wonder if Camille’s (from Sharp Objects) beauty could be considered a power or ability. The novel manages to put an interesting spotlight on it. But, it doesn’t reduce her or her beauty to an archetype.
Couldn’t it be both? Couldn’t her looks be a power and a liability when she uses them inappropriately?
Yes, that is a good point. I bet the author would like that give her attempts to avoid the archetypes surrounding beauty in fiction. Camille is neither an angel or a temptress.
Her beauty is part of her underlying charatcher which allows her to have so many more dimensions than just beauty.
True, of course some people think that the author goes to far by making all her female characters unlikable. They think that this undermines women by portraying them this way.
I always question how the author should portray the protaginist in her own books... What’s appropriate for the author is not for the reader. 
So true that the author and reader can differ on interpretations. I am glad that the author doesn’t fetishize violence though. Many authors do that. She likes to show how it can be deadly to be male too.
That’s a really good point and a nuance most miss. I believe great authors can use sexism and sex as a great distinguisher yet subtle at the same time. 
True, it is interesting how Flynn tries to be psychologically accurate above all. 
Going inside the mind of a ficticious person, created in your mind, must be difficult.
It’s true. Have you ever read drabbles? they are only 100 words long. It is interesting to think how you could go into someone’s mind in 100 words. It must be different then a long novel like sharp objects.
Nice chatting with you.
Hi, how are you?
Great! Hope you’re doing well! Are you a fan of fiction by chance? If so, there’s a wiki you should check out that ranks characters in fiction by their powers and abilities!
I do like comics. I fell in love with it when Edgar allen poe wrote about it.
He wrote the oldest known example of a cyborg, correct? That is awesome! Fiction is derived from the imagination and Poe had a great imagination!
Yeah. I liked Poe. Tell Tale Heart scared the heck out of me!
So true! I would like to read some of Julius Caesar’s Hercules fan fiction sometimes. Or even Oedipus. I bet it’s amazing.
Just don’t show George martin any... He’s not a fan of fan fiction...
Ha! Yeah I heard he claimed it’s copyright infringement and also bad exercises for aspiring writers. I mean, he’s not wrong, but a little over the top I’d say!
I think fan fiction is good. I bet he also complains that people do not write enough or how it is  lonely experience and then also complains about flattery... Seems like an inconsistent thought process.
Agreed! It’s almost as ignorant as the judge who tried to ban a science fiction  comic all because it featured a black character back in 1950! The audacity of some people!
And in 2001 a judge delivered her ruling in the form of a rap. Stay in your lane your honor!
Ha! While trying a suit filed against Eminem! I heard about that. Speaking of Eminem, crazy he wanted to be a comic book artist growing up. What might have been had he pursued that instead if rap!
yeah. I think he chose wisely. I am not sure how successful he would have been at compliment rap though.
Ha! Can’t believe That’s even a thing. But I suppose it’s popular enough in Korea so it must be at least intriguing to see!
Intriguing, like Busta Rhymes voicing the reptar wagon in Rugrats?
Did he really? I’ll have to go back and watch that movie now just to see if I recognize his voice! Ha! Reptar was a lizard right? Better that than a snake - or even a flying snake which there happens to be a genus of that can actually launch themselves at their prey. Imagine coming across one of those. Yikes!
Nope! I would run so fast! I am not a snake fan and then throw in a flying snake.... NOPE!
Same here. It’s crazy that the fear of snakes is hard wired in both the brains of humans and monkeys! 
I know. Poor monkeys have no idea, they just run. My 7 year old asked about getting a snake and I shut that down quickly!
I don’t blame you. I wouldn’t want a snake or even one of those legless lizards that look like snakes even though they basically aren’t. If it looks like a snake, I don’t want it!
Nice chatting with you!
Hello, do you like movies?
I do. Do you like movies?
I do quite a bit. DO you know who hold the record for the most box hits?
Denzel Washington?
It id actually Tom Hanks with $8.5 billion worldwide
WOW! I did love him as the voice of Woody in toy story but I just love pixar.
I love Pixar too. Did you know Disney wanted to shut down their studio because sleeping beauty was a bust
That would have been short sighted. Can you imagine making only $309? I would be so sad...
I know, but good thing they did not shut down the studio
Can you imagine taking your valentines to silence of the lambs?
No, that would be horrible. Do you know which was one of the most expensive office flops?
No, which one?
It was Treasure Planet
I had no clue?
Yeah, too bad for them. Do you like comedy?
yes, I do. Do you?
Yes me too. Do you know which movie Bill Murray thinks is the best comedy?
stripes?
Actually Kung Fu Hustle
WOW! I would have thought it would have been a good movie and not that one. I wonder if he was being sarcastic.
I am wondering about it too. He called it the supreme achievement of the modern age in comedy. Nice chat :)
Hello do you like movies?
Yes, I do.  How about you?
awesome!  Yes I love movies. Tom hanks is the highest box office star!
I love him, he’s such a versatile actor and has played in some of my favorite movies.  Did you know Disney thought about shutting down their studio after Sleeping beauty flopped at the box office?
Yikes, was it that bad?  I have only seen it like once or twice lol.  Glad they didnt, they have come out with some really good stuff
I know right?  I loved it as a kid, I didn’t think it was that bad.  You know I knew Silence of The Lambs made lots of money at the box office, but I didn’t realize it came out on Valentine’s day in 1991.  Did you?
Yeah, so romantic right!  lol that was a great movie,  kinda ironic about the valentines day thing lol
Did you watch the Avengers: Infinity Wars movie ?
Yes, I did,  great movie as well,  I hear it was filmed in all imax cameras! 
I loved it too!  Can’t wait for the next one, I’ll probably cry all over again, when I see who all died at the end of the movie.
Yeah coming out next month I think.  It was pretty sad at the end.  Bring tissue this time!
Thanos sucks!  Anyway, I haven’t seen RBG, have you?
What is that?
Movie about the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  It sounded too dry and I’m not much of a feminist, so I passed on that one.
Oh that one,  no I didnt watch it lol I did read about it. Do you like comedy?
Yes, I do.  Mostly old stuff with Bill Murray, though!
Hes amazing,  real funny!  He thinks kung fu hustle is the supreme acchievement of modern age in terms of comedy.  I dont know about that,  it was a great movie,  but not amazing lol what do you think?
Me either, he must have had a few when he said that!  What I found astonishing was that 3rd rock from the sun beat out Seinfeld, Fraser,and Friends for the 1997 Golden Globe.
Yeah 3rd rock was funny,  but I dont think its better than seinfeld or friends. lol 
I agree, Seinfeld and Friends are classics.  I smell a bribe!
Right!  lol Its weird that comedy central has cancelled over 100 shows.  
Yeah, that is kind of odd!  Well, it’s been nice chatting with you, I need to go walk my dog, now.  
Great chatting, thanks. 
Did know Tom Hanks is the highest all-time box office star?
I didnt know that, I love him as an actor, he is so talented I guess that makes sense
Disney should have used Tom in "treasure planet" it was the most expensive box office flop of all time. HAHA
I bet the movie would have had a bigger box office with him in the movie, did you watch Trojan Wars?
No, I didn’t. I read that it earned over $309,000,000 in box office. Someone is rich.
No, only $309 dollars, it was a failure in fact, it was one of the most expensive box office flops all time
Oh! Thanks for that. I read it wrong.
Yeah, the budget was of $15 million dollars, did you ever watch the movie The Silence of the Lambs?
Yes, that is a very scary movie.
It came out on Valentines day and it had a good box office. That was in the year 1991
Yes, I think I read $270 million in box office.
Yeah, that was a total success so do you like comedy films as well
I love comedy. It’s my favorite.
Do you like Bill Murray? he seems to like Kung Fu hustle a lot. 
I do like him but I don’t know kung fu hustle.
He says is the supreme achievement of modern comedy, well I dont agree with that, I didnt like that movie really
I totally agree with you.
Do you like the channel Comedy Central?
I have watched a few shows on there. My son loves it.
I love it as well but it makes me mad that they’ve cancelled over 100 shows since its creation
I would think that what is funny changes over time.
Yeah I guess so but many of those shows were good! anyways its been nice chatting with you today
Nice chatting with you too.
good morning.
Hi there!  Do you like comedies?
Yeah I love a good comedy.
Me too!  Did you see Bill Murray’s Kung Fu Hustle?
I think I may have seen it. I dont see it as the supreme achievement in comedy like he does though.
I was going to ask what you thought about it.  Jack Black was going to star in the Green Lantern which was originally supposed to be a comedy.  
I think it would have been better as a comedy. I like Jack Black movies.
I love them!  He cracks me up.  I like corny goofball comedy.  I used to like watching 3rd Rock from the Sun when it was on tv for that same reason.
Yeah I liked the goofy brother. Dont remember his name. I thought he was funny.
Yes.  I can picture his face, but can’t remember his name either.  That show won a golden globe for best comedy series in 1997.
considering the other shows that were on at the time that is surprising.
Yes.  It beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier.
Well me personally. I would rather watch third rock any day. Those other shows were quite popular in their day though.
Yes.  I agree.  Do you know who the highest all time box office star is?
Yeah its Tom hanks. Over 8.5 billion in the Box office. Thats a lot of money.
Holy smokes!  You’re not kidding!  Did you know Disney’s animation studios almost shut down after "Sleeping Beauty" was a box office failure?
It may have flopped in the box office, but it became pretty popular after that. I would say they made a good bit of money off sleeping beauty.
I would think so too.  However it wasn’t their biggest flop.  That would have been "Treasure Planet" which was one of the most expensive box office flops of all time!
I dont think I even saw that one.
I remember it, but don’t remember seeing it either.  Silence of the Lambs had a box office of over $270 million and came out on Valentines Day 1991.
That was a good movie. Still a classic. Have  a good one.
Hey how is it going, you ever cook a turkey during Thanksgiving?
No, the only bird I ever cook is chicken; I’m looking to expand my skillset, though! They’re the most numerically successful class of tetrapods.
Ah I gotcha, I was going to say there are some tips to maximize space in the oven during Thanksgiving, but that might just bore both of us haha. That’s pretty cool about chickens, there are over 10000 birds that classify as tetrapods.
I’m sure that some like hummingbirds don’t lend themselves to eating, but I know that ostrich steaks are a thing; I wonder how to cook those! I guess they can be so big because they don’t fly.
True, I’m surprised they still have wings. I cannot believe how small hummingbirds are, only 2 inches!
I guess they’re still evolving to the point where the wings disappear. Some birds don’t get that chance--the famously extinct dodo bird is actually a sub-family a pigeon that I guess didn’t evolve as much as it needed to!
Interesting, it’s funny that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. That is really cool to me.
That’s very resourceful. Some wild birds in Australia are resourceful in mimicking the human world sounds of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaw, although I’m not sure exactly what purpose that would serve.
I’ve heard that, they’re pretty resourceful. I didn’t know how light birds were, their skeleton is hollow and weighs less than the feathers.
Maybe that’s why some birds are able to migrate from Alaska to northern Mexico without sleeping; the light weight must keep them from getting too exhausted.
That is some cardio! They all have feathers, beaked jaws, lay eggs and have a four chambered heart, I wonder how far they are from dinosaurs.
Even if they are distantly related, I bet dinosaurs didn’t dance the way some birds do to impress their potential mates. They’re more closely related to humans in that way.
I bet not. At least they don’t have to worry about having 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week to go through like professional ballet dancers.
That’s a lot, but I guess that kind of dancing is stressful on shoes that are supporting the weight on such as small surface. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school and was even the mouse king in a production of the Nutcracker?
I never knew that, I did know Bruce Lee was a great dancer that won a dancing championship in 1958.
That kind of makes sense, since there’s so much coordinated movement in both martial arts and dance. It would be more odd if a dancer ended up being a video game pro.
True, especially if they became a professional Tetris player lol.
Yes, it is actually one of the three best-selling video games of all time, along with Minecraft and Wii Sports,
I can’t believe it was made in 1984 by Alexy Pajitnov, the government owned the rights to it too.
I guess that’s a consequence of working for the Soviets. Meanwhile, the NHS in the UK actually advocates using the game for people suffering from PTSD.
I could see that, it helps you escape what you are feeling and what not. Could help those suffering from trauma too.
Yes, and research suggests that playing Tetris provides a quick fix for people struggling to stick to diets or quit smoking or drinking.
For sure, a lot of stimulation. I am going to get going though, good talking with you, have a great weekend!
Hi there. Do you like to play video games?
I used to play them when I was younger. I was never good at Tetris though even though it is one of three best selling video games of all. 
I was into Tetris for a while. My mom got addicted to it and stole my Gameboy a lot. I wonder if she started seeing tetris blocks in her sleep. That happens to some people who play tetris for an extended period of time.
That is so weird! As an adult I wish i was good at Tetris when I quit smoking or trying to diet because it can offer a quick fix when people are struggling to stick to working on either.
Yeah, and they also will regularly identify tetromino shapes in real life like in patterns on buldings or in layouts of boxes. Haha, hilarous.
Okay, well then maybe I’m not so sad that I am not good at it. I would not want to deal with that.
Right? Haha. I didn’t know that Tetris was actually from the Soviet Union. I thought it was just part of the Tetris design where there were Russian buildings.
Yes, Alexey Pajitinov was the original designer and programmer.
You mentioned that Tetris can help with addictions. Well it can also help with PTSD. So if you can deal with seeing Tetris shapes everywhere it might be a good option for PTSD.
Oh! I’m glad you’re still here. I thought you were gone. Well, that is great for PTSD sufferers. 
No, it just takes me a while to think of what to say. Do you ever play dance video games?
No, but I enjoy dance performances. Did you know Tupac was a ballet dancer?
That is neat. Speaking of ballet dancers, they can go through four pairs of pointe shoes a week. Sounds painful and expensive!
Yes, that does, I agree! I think its cute that babies hear music and spontaneously dance.
When they hit the beat! So babies can hit the beat but it seems like a lot of us adult forget how to, haha.
I know I have a hard time! When babies hit the beat it makes them smile.
One thing that makes me smileis Michael Jackson’s dance. I didn’t know that to achieve lean he used a device which he patented.
That was smart. those moves were pretty extreme, so that explains a lot of how it was done.
Right. Bruce Lee was another great dancer. He won a Cha Cha championship.
Did he really? Where did he do that? In the USA? Sounds like he is a multi-talented guy.
That was in Hong Kong.Now I want to see if there is any footage of him dancing. Have a good day!
Do you like birds?  I love watching them!
I do, too! So many of them are beautiful, and even the ones that aren’t are still incredibly unique. They can be anywhere between 2 inches or 9 feet!
I think it’s incredible how easily they can fly.  It’s probably because their bones are so hollow that the entire skeleton weighs less than the feathers!
Probably! Did you know one of the smallest birds, a hummingbird, will actually steal spider webs construct and repair their nests?
That’s funny!  There are wild birds in Australia that can mimic the sound of cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That could get noisey!
Wow. I wonder if they’re in the parrot family or if other birds outside of the parrot family can mimic sounds like that?
That’s a good possibility!  The extinct dodo bird is actually a sub family of pigeon.  Interesting.
That is interesting! Can you believe there are some birds that will migrate all the way from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping?
That’s pretty incredible!  Do you like to dance?
Only if I’ve had a couple of drinks, but I respect the art form absolutely. How about you?
I can’t dance but wish I could.  Tupac danced ballet in high school and ended up portraying the mouse king in the Nutcracker!
That’s pretty impressive! Bruce Lee was also evidently a pretty good dancer. He won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha Championship in 1958!
Wow.  I had no idea he danced but I can see that going hand in hand with the karate moves.
Most definitely. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music? I guess we as humans appreciate rhythm regardless of age!
I didn’t know that.  Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week.  That could get expensive!
Definitely! Though I can imagine why, standing on your tip-toes so frequently with all of your body weight must be extremely taxing on shoes!
Ouch!  That’s all I’ll say.  I would have broken toes.  Michael Jackson has a patent on a device that was used to help him achieve the extreme lean in some of his dance moves.
Hey, have you ever played Tetris?
I did back in the day.  The 3 best selling videogames of all time are Tetris, Minecraft, and Wii sports.  I had fun chatting with you!
You, too! I may go play some tetris, but that whole phenomenon of blocks falling in my sleep if I play too long freaks me out!
LOL Have a great night!
Hello! What do you enjoy doing for entertainment?
I really love to cook. Thanksgiving in my favorite holiday to cook for. Planning the meal and making everything fit on my oven is like tetris.
Yes, so do I! and I agree, Thanksgiving and Chsitmas are my favorite Holidays. and you are right especially if you only have one oven to work with like susan westmoreland says "it’s a bit like an acrobatic dance" lol
Great way to make a word picture, yes! I would totally agree. Planning backwards are what some experts say to do, like Susan Gage Caterers.
haha, true! Another of my all time fav things to do would be dance! although my back doesnt like it so much. I love watching dance videos...
Oh yeah, me too!Dancing while I bake pies for Thanksgiving is an exacta. I have a guilty pleasure of dancing to ballet musicals. I read that those ballerinas go through four pairs of pointe shoes per week.!
That is a daily, cooking and dancing! and ouch! 4 pairs! Oh my word, that beats my once every year. Another great dance was Michael Jackson, he had a patent on a device, I didnt know you could achieve lean in dance moves
Really, that is a cool fact. I liked his music even though the person is in question.
True, its hard to know truth from lies in the media unfortunately, Bruce lee was also a great dancer he even won the hong kong cha-cha championship in 1958! I didnt know there was such a thing.
The Cha Cha winner! How cool is that, Bruce Lee was an amazing athlete all the way around. I think its so sweet how babies can spontaneously dance when they hear music.lol
Yes, I have 2 year old twin boys and they Love to "shake shake shake, shake your booty" haha they crack up everytime. They love to dance and watch our birds. Do you have birds?
How precious! lol. Oh yeah, we have many many birds that come fly into our windows, in fact. Hummingbirds steal the spider webs to construct the own nests too, thats a nice bonus for me and less cleaning too.
Wow, yes birds are amazing creatures and so light! their light bones are so hollow sometimes weighing less than their feathers. Love them.
Yes, so delightful and treasured. Mine will mimic things that make me run looking for alarms sometimes.lol
haha, I always wondered what such distances they can fly without resting. Ive learned that some birds can fly from alaska to northern mexico without sleeping.. I wish I could fly! Vacations would be way cheaper!
Gosh, that’s a good point and they would be a lot more affordable. I am addicted to playing tetris when I fly because it takes my mind off of flying. Tetris is proven to be a quick and manageable fix for people who are trying to stick to a diet, quit smoking or drinking. I use it for flying.
Tetris! such a great game, reminds me of my youth, Its been around since ive been around lol well I guess tetris is a few years older 1984 it was created! 
Yes, mine too. It is one of three of the greatest games of all time. Minecraft and Sport Wii are the other two. The tetris game has been used to help people suffering with PTSD,also.
Interesting! Do you know where it was created?
Yes, it was created in Russia by a man who almost never made any money from it but eventually he did in 1996. I must admit I had the tetris effect for a while after I played. I would see everything in blocks and a way to fit.
Wow, It was truly a great invention and it traveled such a far way... from Russia!
Gosh, yes it did. Over every ocean too. The franchise sold more than 495 million copies not counting all the downloads in todays time.
I learned so much today, Thank you. It was fun chatting with you! Hugs and much Love to you! Take care!
Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;)
Me too.  Would you believe it if I told you that the Chicago Cubs last won a World Series when the Ottoman Empire was still in existence?
am... no, I don’t think I would believe that... ;) was that in Wikipedia ? ;) lol
Maybe a saved version of wikipedia.  I won’t soon forget when the Cubs really did win, back in 2016, over my Indians.
Your ? ;)  at that time You were cheering for Indians ?
Yes.  I’m not the owner of the team ;) ... they’re just from my hometown.
Although I’m Polish - I got that ;) lol. How are they doing these days ?
Pretty good, on top of their division last year, but no where as good as the Red Sox.  They had an amazing start to the year, and then they won the World Series.
Holy crap, nice. Probably fat bonuses for everybody... but hey... if they made their fans happy, why the heck not... they earned it !
They did.  It was almost too easy.  They have great pitchers, good hitters, and a new manager.  Normally, a new manager isn’t a help, but he was from the team who won the World Series the year before, The Houston Astros.
Huh... do You think he knows a secret for winning World Series ? ;)  idk... I think it’s just a well paid team ;)
Money and chemistry build winning teams, if you ask me.  Baseball is popular in the US, Japan, and a few other places.  Is it played much in Poland?
Not really, but we do buy baseball bats :) to go watch soccer games on a stadium :)
You buy bats?  Why?  I used to collect baseball cards, which can be quite valuable!
well... when one soccer team meets other soccer team and those two towns/teams are not friendly... You need to take whatever You can smuggle to the stadium to fight off the hooligans from the other team ;) lol - baseball bats are selling good in Poland but nobody plays the game ;) lol
ah ... that’s a little scary.  I suppose without a baseball bat, my simple weapon of choice would be  ...  something else I can’t think of.  Fascinating.  I do like soccer.  I’m a Croat (half really), so the World Cup was exciting this year.  Unfortunately, only the women’s world cup is more popular in the US than the baseball world series.
Croatia won out hearts this Worldcup - seriously - great job guys   ! It was a pleasure to watch Your matches !
Do you think Modric was really the best player in the tournament?
In the entire tournament? Maybe not the actual best, but he showed a lot of passion for sure !
Fair enough.  Do you think soccer coaches are important to the winning of a team, like they are in baseball?
they sure are, but these days with so much primadonnas in the team, I think they have a tough job to do...
Yes, I get the impression that soccer players are paid very much.  Baseball has some of those, but only a few total and maybe one or two on each team.
Yeah.... that among some other reasons doomed our Polish team in World Cup... sad really...
Well, I would root for the Polish team.  I have great respect for your country.
as my for Yours brother ;)  what a kind thing to say, thank You ! :)
Thank you.  It was nice to talk with you.
Would you much of a baseball fan?
A little.  I just read something about the Boston Red Sox.  They has some hard core fans.
I guess they are doing well at the moment.  they went so long without winning anything and now they can’t stop.
Yeah. Mookie Betts seems to really be getting some distance on his hits. 
That’s a new name to me, seems like a name from a Star Wars movie.  I wonder if they are the best team in baseball right now?
I really don’t know.  They have a picture named Porcello that is really good.  It sounds like they have a good balance between pitching and hitting.
I’m originally from a different country but my wife is from Cleveland.  She used to get very excited in the late nineties when they had a good team.
That’s cool.  I guess FanGraphs estimates that the Red Sox have a 71% chance to win the division.  That’s good for your wife.  What country are you from?
England, been here over twenty years.  Have not really got into baseball, went to a few games in the past at Camden Yard and Jacobs Field.
Well, a very belated "welcome".  Are you a cricket fan?  I didn’t realize that the NYT owned part of the Sox.  
I am, used to play to a fairly high level.  Isn’t that sacrilege for the NYT to be involved with Boston, or are they just hedging their bets.
Yes, I had the same thought.  They are such rivals.  It’s wild that baseball managers can actually play in the game.  I have never seen that.
I guess it’s in the rules, that’s why they wear the uniform.  I’d love to see one of those really old managers walk up to bat one day.
Yeah.  It would be even better if that old manager knocked it out of the park.  Babe Ruth didn’t look like an athlete so why not?
So who did win the world series this year?  Was it Boston or another team?
The Sox.  They played the LA Dodgers.  I’m actually a Royals fan and it was a bad year.  As an aside, I had no idea Babe Ruth blew a World Series by getting caught stealing in 1926.  Say it ain’t so Babe!
He was an exceptional player, but he doesn’t strike me as someone who was quick on his feet.  New York should be able to forgive him
I’m sure they have.  It’s also hard to believe that the Cubs won back-to-back World Series games.  They have been mediocre for years.
Guess all the curses are going away, there must be a statute of limitations on them.
Ha!  Yes, the "Curse of the Bambino" apparently was rescinded.  The Sox won last...
Nice talking with you, Go Royals!
Do you watch baseball much?
Yea I watch it during the world series when the AL champion faces off against the NL champion
Nice I enjoy watching the world series, my favorite team is the Red Sox, they won it this year!
Yea, they’ve been pretty good, kinda crazy the NY Giants refused to play them in the 1904 world series
wow, I did not know that. Did you know the red sox have lost every game on ben afflecks birthday since 1997
No, I guess Ben Afflecks birthday is bad luck for the Red Sox
I guess so lol! Do you ever collect baseball cards?
Yea but I never found 3 million dollars worth of cards in an attic before
Me too lol, talk about retiring early, wow! I wonder what cards he found in there. Maybe a babe ruth?
Possibly. It’s crazy Ruth ended game 7 trying to steal home in the 1926 World Series
wow, talk about ruining it for your team! Was he a yankee at the time or a red sox, I can’t remember
Had to be a yankee since Ruth was playing in the 1926 world series
true, lol duh! Do you know why baseball managers wear uniforms?
Because the manager can technically play in the game, I know Pete Rose did a few times as manager
wow, that makes sense! I played semi pro and my manager jumped in a couple times, he was like 50 at the time!
That’s pretty crazy. Do you know up until 2005 the MLB schedules were done by a married couple?
What do you mean, they went to the games until then or they created the schedules?
They would make the schedule for all 2430 mlb games
wow that would be so crazy and intense. I would like to be part of that though some day. I wonder who makes  them now. Good chatting with you!
Nice chatting with you too, I think I’m gonna try to look for old baseball cards in my attic
Me too lol, or my grandpas, bye!
Do you like dogs?
Yes, I do.  What’s your favorite breed?
I’m more of a cat person. I was surprised to read there are 12 different dog blood types and that they can donate blood to eachother. Pretty cool. 
That is cool. Dogs are not colour blind, but cannot see as many different colours as humans
That’s interesting. Google’s code of conduct mentions that they are a dog company!
Haha, yeah.  Me too!
Dogs and elephants are the only animals that seem to instinctively understand pointing.
That’s neat.  Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for the city’s stray dogs in exchange for recycled plastic bottles.
Wow, that’s awesome. The dog was the first species to be domesticated.
A critical step in creation of wi-fi was a byproduct of research into improving astronomy imaging
Interesting! Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.
Bill nye the science guy is the executive director of the planetary society, an astronomy organization founded by the great carl sagan.
That’s neat! Saadat shahr is a small rural community in iran nicknamed ’Astronomy Town’ because of the residents’ passion for stargazing.
That’s cool.  Didn’t realize that.
Yeah, the town clubbed together to pay for an observatory and on special occasions all the lights are cut to improve the view of the night sky.
The fda burned six tons of literature in an act of us censorship
That’s a shame. There is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel.
In 1953 sir winston churchill won a nobel prize, and it was in literature, not peace.
I didn’t know that. Literature was an olympic event from 1912 until 1952!
Architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture were olympic events from 1912 until 1952.
I learned a lot, Thanks for chatting! 
Do you like Baseball?
I do, I watch mainly during the world series times though
Same here, I rooted for LA since I am from Cali.  But Boston is good too.
I always rooted for Atlanta growing up.  They were a lot more dominant then.
I rooted for the A’s.  That was crazy when the A’s played the SF Giants and we had the Earthquake here.  We won and got that Commisioners Trophy!
Wow, an earthquake during a game?  
Yep.  The big one where a section of the Bay Bridge collapsed and the Marina District caught on fire.  The game was suspended for a few days but I think A’s won it 4 of 4 out of 7 games possible.
Wow.  Thats crazy.  Im from Florida, so we have hurricanes, but we have quite a bit more warning.  lol
Did you know the baseball coaches wear uniforms because they can actually play if needed lol.
Yeah, I wonder if they ever needed to step in, or it is just a tradition.
I think it is in the rule book.  It is called America’s pastime but I dont know....seems like there are more NFL and NBA fans at least out here.
It does seem that way around here too.  Baseball is actually really popular in Japan.
I heard that often...what is weird is why Kickball is called Soccer-Baseball in canada?
It kinda makes since you kick it and operate like baseball, but seems clunky as a name, in my opinion
I guess a leg subs for the bat lol.
Yeah.  Did you know that the albuquerque isotopes are named after the team in the Simpsons?
Smart, use a team already branded by one of the longest running shows in history.  
It would help sell merch.  people would want some because of the show.  
I don’t think anyone will copy the Red Sox name, they have had it since 1901!
Thats a long time.  I heard they started wearing red socks after the team the red stockings dropped red from their uniform.
I might have to watch a little baseball this season now lol.. take care
You too!  Good chat!
Hi! Are you a fan of baseball, got any favorite sports teams?
I like baseball, but I don’t really have a favorite team. Do you?
Don’t have a favorite team either but my friends are huge Red Sox fans not sure if it’s because they have gone on to win nine world series championships or what but with those stats, seems like a great accomplishment.
Well they have an amazing performance. Did you know Lebron James partly own the boston red sox?
Oh really? I didn’t know that, that must be a great investment! Lots of fans have superstitions surrounding games, do you have any? 
Indeed. Do you like the mlb?
Not really, the only player I’m familiar with is Babe Ruth who was caught stealing to end the game and lose the world series in 1926.
Well it has its pros and cons. After a 17yr old female pitcher struck out babe ruth and lou gehrig, she was banned from pro baseball
I wonder how that banning action would fare in today’s world and society, you think it would receive negative press?
I think it would. Most men sports leagues don’t outright ban females. They usually just have very difficult requirement to meet for females like the nfl
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I wonder if thee were collectible cards and females did make it to play on the male dominant teams, would the cards be as valuable as other cards or extra valuable, like a man found three million dollars worth of cards in his grandfathers attic!
I guess attics are treasure troves
For some, unless its the attic of a hoarder. I wonder whether other sports team have requirements like baseball managers where they have to wear the uniforms because they have to play if the need arises.
I still haven’t seen the manager ever play. Are managers bench players?
Don’t think so, but some of those managers aren’t in great shape to be playing on the fields, if anything, they should just forfeit the game to save the managers from embarrassment. 
True. i was surprised that if a player catches a ball in their hat, the opposing team gets 3 bases
Yeah, I have yet to see that happen on tv nor have seen anyone attempt to do that. In Japan, baseball is also considered one of its national past time by how popular it is there.
I personally don’t find watching baseball games to be entertaining although I do enjoy baseball. Games here are fundamental different in atmosphere as asia
Yeah, when you have much more physical games like football and basketball, baseball and even golf can be quite boring. Even the broadcasting of the World Series is boring to me unless the marine corps did something like they did in 1992 world series where they carried the Canada Flag into the stadium and it was upside down!
I wonder if it would be more exciting if the dodgers finally win a world series champion. they have more losses than any other team
It sure has been a while since the Dodgers won. Have a good day
Hi, how are you?
Hi! Good!
Do you enjoy baseball?
I do like baseball, but I don’t really follow it. How about you?
I love it. Watch a lot of games every year and can’t wait until spring training... Babe ruth was caught stealing to end game 7 and lose the 1926 world series with his team down by one run.
Wow, that’s awesome! Who is your favorite Baseball team? I like my Az team lol
Chicago Cubs. I’m from Chicago so... Love going to Wrigley!
O wow, that must be fantastic! I also like the Boston Red Sox, did you know the new york times has partial ownership?
I did. Baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises
Cool and smart! The Red Sox have won 9 world series games!
That’s a lot! Up until 2005, a married couple, for 24 years, scheduled all 2430 major league baseball games played each year
Really! That is a lot, crazy! I didn’t know that in Canada kickball is also called soccer-baseball, interesting!
A man found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic- hidden since the 1940s. 
Whoa, what a lucky find that was! Did you know the Chicago Cubs were the 1st to win back to back world series....but haven’t won since....but I bet you know that!
I did. And they won in 2016 so that/s inaccurate. But it’s not your fault... You’ve been great!
Ohh, haha sorry....So in 1992 world series the US Marine corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down! nuts!
WHAT? That’s a lot disrespectful. Crazy...
Right! I don’t know if that was a mistake or not....
I hope it was... At least it wasn’t on national TV...
I hope not too! Gotta love the world series!
Nice chatting with you.
Great chatting with you too! Have a good one!
You too
Hey, you a fan of any sports involving hitting balls with sticks?
Many such games fit that description.   Golf is one I enjoy.
I like golf a lot. It’s a real shame how much water is wasted per day on each course, though. It’s over 300,000 gallons a day a course!
True, but consider that golf courses in America combined are larger than the size of two small US states!
Yeah, golf must be pretty popular in that case. Did you know there exists a golf course in Dubai that uses around 4 million gallons a day? That must cost a lot of money.
I suppose that comes with games that cannot and do not utilize a standardized playing area
You know what games do utilize a standardized playing area? Baseball and softball. The fields are pretty similar.
Interesting.    Babe Ruth was both a famous golfer and baseball player!
Speaking of famous people who play sports, Samuel L. Jackson actually plays golf twice a week during filming of whatever he’s in.
Cool.    Did you know Jose canseco claims to hold the record for longest softball homerun at 622 feet
Woah, that’s really far! Softball players don’t make a lot of money. It’s usually between $5,000 and $6,000.
Well, what do you expect with a game invented at the YMCA?
Softball may have been invented at the YMCA, but it’s pretty much a lesser baseball, which is America’s national pastime. 
Someone asked me about points in baseball, and I had to explain they are runs!
Yeah, golf uses points called strokes though. Unlike baseball, less is more in golf.
Funny how things get named - like golf uses clubs, but baseball uses a bat.
Softball uses a bat as well.
True.    I wonder if they called it that when they used an actual soft ball.
I wonder if the fact that the game used to use a soft ball but now uses a hard ball has any influence on the records.
It probably does, although more important is that softball started as an indoor sport.
That is pretty important, but it’s usually played outside nowadays. Baseball started outdoor and remained outdoor.
Probably for the best, although I wouldn’t want to be outside for a 31 inning game!     Thanks for the chat!
How’s it going? Do you like sports?
Pretty good.  You?  I do like sports.  I’m glad baseball season is about to start back up!
Did you know there is a golf course in Dubai that requires 4 million gallons of water a day? Seems like such a needless waste.
No I didn’t but I totally agree with you.  I guess Dubai is in a desert region so they need a lot of water to keep the grass green but it still seems wrong just to play golf on it.
Even the ones in the US only use 312k gallons a day, which is no small amount, but is much less than that one single course.
Isn’t Dubai mostly for the wealthy?  That could explain the excess.
It actually is not even as wealthy as New York or London. It is only marketed to seem very wealthy when in reality it isn’t all that much. Abu Dhabi is actually the most wealthy city in the world.
I didn’t know that! I always thought it was Dubai. It looks like I’ve believed the hype.  Speaking of hype, did you know that Babe Ruth was one our most famous golfers?
He must have been much better than Micheal Jordan haha. Did you know Samuel L Jackson puts a golf clause in his contracts that allows him to play golf twice a week during production of a movie? He must really love golf.
He really must and people must love him to allow it in his contracts!  
Did you know kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada? That’s kind of weird.
It does sound weird.   Did you know that the ymca invented softball?
They also invented volleyball,softball and basketball. I find it hard to believe the basketball one though, pretty sure it was around before the YMCA, I could be wrong though.
I don’t know. I heard somewhere that James Naismith invented basketball.  I’m not sure if he was with the ymca or not.  
A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards in his grandfathers attic, talk about a stroke of luck!
That is lucky!  You know, I’ve heard that baseball is super popular in Japan.  Over there they are surprised to learn it’s our national pastime.
Man as of 2014 the average salary for a pro softball player was between 5,000 and 6,000, does not sound like a good sport to become a pro in.
No it really doesn’t.  It’s odd that’s it’s so low considering softball was the first sport shown on espn.
Well i would say soccer is probably the best sport to go pro in because they make more money than basketball,football,and golf combined.
I agree.  speaking of softball though, did you know that the longest game in college history lasted 31 innings?
Wow that is crazy long. Well it was nice chatting with you. Have a good day.
Good morning!  Do you watch baseball?  It can be a lucrative thing to be a fan of the game.  A man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards once.
I am a baseball fan. I used to collect cards but I really doubt mine are worth 3 million dollars.
After hearing about that man I wish I had collected them.  The ones he found though were from the 1900s.  They had been stashed away since the 1940s. 
I could only imagine how exciting that was. My cards were from the late 1980s and 1990s, there were a lot of sets made then. I bet there were a lot less made in the 1900s.
I don’t know actually.  The weird thing about baseball is that it’s america’s national pastime but it is super popular in Japan of all places.
I know that a few countries in Asia have really taken up baseball. A lot of former MLB players play in Korea as well.
I’ve heard that before.  Japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that it comes from america.
That surprises me because after World War 2 they have become a lot more open to Western culture and adopting some of our styles and customs.
It is surprising.  Speaking of surprising, did you know that the reason the managers wear uniforms is so they can go in the game if needed?
In previous years some players played a dual role as a manager as well. Now I don’t think most managers would be able to last in the game.
True, some of them look a bit out of practice.  What do you think of softball?  I didn’t know it was invented by the ymca.
I did not know that either. I enjoy playing softball, it is a lot more fun to play recreationally than baseball.
i like playing too.  What i learned recently was that it was originally invented as an indoor game though. I never knew that before!
I can’t imagine it as an indoor game, that seems more like wiffleball to me.
It does seem odd.  You know, it’s supposed to be a faster game than regular baseball and yet the longest softball game in history went for 31 innings.  That is a long game!
Any league I’ve played in always had rules to prevent that from happening! I couldn’t imagine being involved for 31 innings, that’s almost 3 baseball games.
I imagine it was pretty tiring for everyone.  Softball really doesn’t get as much respect as baseball even with that super long game.  Professional players only make around 5 or 6 thousand dollars a year.
It’s really hard to turn your sport into a major force in the US. With the popularity of the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL, they dominate the sports scene.
They definitely do at that.  It’s sad to think about it though because the game has been around since 1887.
At least the YMCA created basketball and therefore one of the major sports leagues around today. Not bad for a recreational game they thought up.
True. They invented volleyball too.
hi how are you? do you like sports?
I’m doing very well, thanks. I love sports
do you like golf? i have never played golf.
I love golf. Its a great sport where individual players hit balls with clubs into a series of holes on a golf course in as few strokes as possible.
I never played because it looked expensive. How long have you played?
I have been playing for about 10 years now and another thing I wanted to mention that the golf course consists of 18 holes but if you play the game for fun its usually 9 holes.
Ok, but doesnt it cost a lot for the equipment and the greens fees and stuff?
Well that depends on the equipment you buy and also where you play.
I guess i would want the cheapest stuff. i played sports with minimal equipment growing up.
The gold course requires a lot of water to maintain about 312,000 gallons in fact per day.
That sounds like quite a bit. it is ok in some places, but maybe where water is scarce, it is not ideal.
This is just the average for American golf courses. I read somewhere that a golf course in Dubai requires 4,000,000 gallons of water per day to maintain.
That is insane. in a desert country? it seems excessive, but i guess that the rich have the money for that kind of hobby.
I agree. Do you know any famous baseball player that is also a very famous golfer?
Is this a recent player? i know that a lot of them play gofl.
No this baseball player was back in the 1920s.
The babe? Did he play golf? He could hit a ball pretty fall.
You guessed it correctly. Babe Ruth, he was a fantastic baseball player and at one point America’s most famous golfer.
That is amazing. he was a big fellow though. i bet he could drive it pretty far. Anyway, great chat!
Yes he was. It was nice chatting with you as well. Have a nice night!!!
You too! Have a nice weekend!
you have a nice weekend as well. 
Thanks!
Bye!!!
Do you watch the show Fixer Upper?
Hello, I do. What about you?
I have yes. They are having another baby
That’s pretty cool. Do you like attending concerts?
I do. I would love to go to a show at an old roman amphitheater
That would be very cool to see. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts back in 2001?
Thats a lot of shows. They were very popular when they first hit the scene
I agree. I love Linkin Park. What about you?
I do as well. Sad about chester
I agree. Such a waste of talent to go out like that.
Just like the waste during a 2002 concert. Creed was sued because it was so bad
That’s funny they were sued. I bet it was very bad.
Are there any artist that you would like to see live?
I would love to see Pink Floyd. What about you?
Eminem is on my bucket list. He made kanye rewrite his part in a song after hearing eminems verse
It would be very cool to see Eminem. The Ramones played 2263 concerts in 20 years.
That must of taken a toll on them. 20 years non stop
I bet. Do you like Drake?
He is ok. Makes good club music
I agree. Not music I would listen to on a daily basis.
Did you know he didnt graduate high school until 25?
I did not know that. Very interesting. Well, it was good chatting with you.
Hello, do you like Drake as a singer?
Hey there, yes he is okay. Do you know his real name?
Yes it is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is a Canadian
Yes he is. He graduate high school at 25
Better late than never I guess. He also seems to be a lot into kids books like winnie the phooh and charlotte’s web
Yeah I wonder who it was for though. Did you know the beat from hotline bling is sampled?
Oh yeah heard that it was sampled from Why we can’t live together of TImmy THomas
Yeah pretty cool, that song was out before Drake was born back in 1972
Yeah exactly. Once he visited Drake University in the middle of the night when the students did not expect it
Wow that must have been awesome for them. Do you go to concerts much?
I do from time to time. In 2001 Linkin Park played 324 concerts alone, mind blowing
When did they rest? Wow that is pretty amazing. THe Ramon toured for 20 years too
Right, and they played a staggering 2263 concerts during that time
WOw, those guys honestly. In Craotia there is an ancient theater that is still used for concerts
Hmm sounds like the one PInk FLoyd used in Pompeii for a concert without an audience
What a waste, I would have liked to be there for sure. Creed concerts was really bad though that they got sued
Wow must have been really bad then. DO you ever shop at target?
Yes quite a bit. They will match Amazon prices so it makes it a good place to shop
Nice I did not know that. There is no Target in Vermont though
SO I guess they have to stick with Amazon. And they do not carry tobacco products since 19
96
Hmm so I guess not a good spot for smokers either
do you go to concerts?
I go when I can, how about you?
Me too. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001?
Wow that is amazing. How did they have time to rest?
Exactly. The ramones also toured for 20 years straight
WOw that is amazing. Did you know ABBA turned down an offer to have a reunion?
Yeah they played 2263 concerts during that time. They did, why?
Wow amazing. Yes, they turned down a $1 billion offer
WOw. A Creed concert was really bad that people sued them once
That is too bad. DO you like Drake?
I like him somewhat. Do you know when he graduated high school?
Hmm I am not sure actually, was it recent?
Yes pretty recent, it was in 2012 when he was 25
Yeah better late than never I guess for him, he was busy otherwise
True . DO you know his real name or full name?
Yes his name is Aubrey Drake Graham and he is Canadian
Yeah. Did you know the beat for Hotline Bling is sampled?
Did not know that, from which song?
It is the song WHy can;t we live together?
Nice. Did you know he was in Degrassi?
Did not know that, pretty cool an actor as well. Nice chatting with you
Same here, have a good one.
Hello there, do you attend many concerts these days?
Nope. More of a TV watcher. But know a little about the fabulously successful rapper, Drake Graham, or Drake, from Canada. Heard of him?
Yeah I have heard of him, he has made some good songs.  Do you know what age he graduated high school?
They say age 25. I’m guessing that he may have received a GED.  He’s been in show business, first, a TV series called Degrassi: The Next Generation, ever since Drake was a 14 year old. Maybe dropped out of school in about 9th grade?
Yeah what I think is that he started so young he didn’t have time to finish, but eventually did a GED type program.  I’m sure he is more than smart enough. 
Absolutely. I’d say the guy found his calling in the music industry, especially rap. He’s also written songs, produced albums and become a savvy entrepreneur, they say. Not just your average Next Generation kid!
No, he is not, I know he has won multiple grammys as well!
Yes, earned his 2st Grammy in 2011, and has earned more for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Album.
That is very impressive.  Did you know he once sampled a Timmy Thomas hit?
No. As I mentioned, I’m more of a TV watcher. Although I’m not into reality TV much, one show I’ll miss that’s recently concluded after 5 seasons on HGTV is Fixer Upper. Ever see it?
No thats not one that I have seen before, is it pretty good?
It was, actually. Chip and Joanna Gaines, a conservative evangelical couple from Texas, who did not impose their religious beliefs on TV audiences, but were clearly sincere down-home folks, took houses needed fixing and turned them into dream homes for clients. It was heartwarming, and the couple were fun-loving.
That sounds pretty entertaining, I might have to check it out when I can. 
You’ll have to catch back episodes from their 5 seasons (2013 to 2018). Recently they welcomed their 5th child, and ended the show, they said, to put their family 1st again. There’s a whole genre of fix-up shows, PBS, on TV today. Who knew?
Well I can respect them making that decision, I’m sure it’s best for their family. 
Agreed. Sorry, I meant to say that there’s a whole genre of fix-it shows, all of which stem from This Old House, now on PBS, on several networks, including HGTV, today.
Oh ok, yeah I think I have heard of some of those shows before as well. 
If you want to see more of the Gaines couples work, they’re written best-selling books and have a home goods line featured at Target stores. Have a Target reasonably close to you? Do you shop there?
Yeah we do have a Target in town, I think I will check that out, thanks!
I know Target well because I witnessed their growth from one location in the Roseville Shopping Center in the suburban Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis, MN to Target becoming the 8th-largest US retail department store today. Ever heard about Target’s history?
No, I can’t say I know a whole lot about that.  But, it’s been nice chatting with you today, I hope you have a good day!
I am sure that you know that Black Panther is a Marvel Comics character, right?
The richest superhero. Worth $500 billion.
That’s the one!  The origins of the script for the movie date back to the 4th century.
The character was not named after the black panther party.
No.  LOL.  Caught me off guard with that.  The old script was written in Nigeria.
Chadwick Boseman played the character Black Panther.
The film was sure a block buster.  Apparently Denzel Washington helped him get his education.
Supporting his training at Oxford.
I see.  To change the subject, did you know that over 80 of the earth’s forest have been destroyed in the history of our planet?
I believe it. We need the land for farming and people want the lumber.
Yes.  I heard that when the Europeans discovered North America, a squirrel could go from coast to coast without touching the ground. Now we expect to have no helium left on earth is less than 82 years.
I wonder if the aliens will need the helium when they finally settle on our planet. The UN now has an ambassador for extraterrestrials.
Unless there really is "warp speed" I think it will take aliens too long to get here.  I did hear about that ambassador being appointed in 2010.
The earth covered mostly with water in the form of oceans. I think that the aliens might want our planet for the water.
Could be.  But if they don’t have any they won’t know that they find it useful.  Fortunately for sea levels, both of our poles are covered with ice.
Do you read non-fiction? It’s fascinating stuff.
I have read quite a bit.  I like Grisham and Clancy.  But I also like the best selling non-fiction book, the Bible.
Jack London lived as a poor person in London, and wrote a book about it.
It is hard to write about things one has not experienced.  That is why Grisham’s books are about the law.  George W Bush reading 14 biographies of Lincoln is a person trying hard to do well.
He also read a lot of nonfiction. Good way to get an education. No need for school. 
I agree.  Education should continue through one’s life.  Who would have thought that one of only 8 people to have both a fiction and non-fiction best seller would be a country singer?
A man of many talents! Well, I enjoyed chatting!
Me too, nice chat.
Hello there, did you see the Black Panther film that was recently in theaters?
Yea, I think Chawick Boseman did a great job as T’Challa
I have yet to see the movie but I heard that he did a really good job as well. 
Ryan Coogler did an awesome job directing Black Panther and Michael B Jordan was good too
I heard the same thing.  I guess the black panther is the richest superhero there is as well. 
Yea, apparently Black Panther is worth more than Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne combined
That is crazy! I never knew there was one that had more money than those guys. 
Yea, in the comics Black Panther is worth 500 billion dollars
Did you know that some of the symbols and written scripts used in the movie were based on actual script dating back to the 4th century?
Yea, based on Nsibdi from the Nigeria region
I think that is very cool, I always like it when those types of movies use actual history references. 
Yea but it’s unfortunate that they censored the phrase "praise hanuman" from the indian release of Black Panther
That sounds really stupid to me, that overly pc stuff has gotten a bit too much for me. 
The Indians weren’t happy they censored it either and thought it was empowering rather than insulting
Yeah and I don’t blame them for feeling that way to be honest. 
Yea people can be sensitive over trivial stuff instead of important things, like 80% of natural forests being destroyed
Exactly, that is so alarming and people are more concerned with silly stuff. 
Yea like the UN appointing an official ambassador to extraterrestrials 
That too, I wonder how much the salary is for that job?
Too much, I’m pretty worried the earth will be helium free by the end of the century
Yeah I wonder what all the party balloon companies will do to survive.  Anyways, it’s been nice talking with you, I hope you have a good day!
Hello. Its pretty cold today. It makes me wonder whether more of the earth’s polar regions are covered with ice today. 
I know it is freezing... in Chicago it is near -24. So cold!
Wow!! Its definitely a good day to stay in and catch some movies. Speaking of movies, Black Panther has the richest superhero out there, worth $500 billion!
That’s a lot of money. They are re-releasing th emovie for free from February 1 - 7 for african american month...
Wow!! Thats amzinzing. I know there was a lot of confusion when the movie was first released...many people confused it with the black panther party. 
Yeah, they are a lot different. T’challa is the richest superhero/
That’s interesting! You know, there’s a lot that we can do with this extra day off with the cold and all...we have the whole day to indulge. Did you know that when the Earth was first formed, a day was only 5.5 hours long?
I had no idea. I do know that I am working on this cold day and worked out this morning. It has been a cold day!
Yes it has. The weather and the earth’s atmosphere is forever changing. By the 21st century, we anticipate running out of Helium. That’s going to significantly impact human life...scary!!
How is it going to impact humans> I am curious to know more!
Well, for one, Helium makes up a large portion of our atmosphere. I do know that. And Helium helps to keep things floating so I can only imagine the impact will be negative!
Thanks for the insight. I had no idea!
I’m just thinking about how our atmosphere works... I’, no expert but I think its safe to say that the absence of Helium could come at a high cost.
I agree. I had no idea that it was that precious.
Yessss!! I guess we could gain more insight about what the future holds for humanity by reading the bible. Did you know that the bible is the biggest selling non-fiction book ever printed? That’s pretty impressive!
I did. George W bush read 41 biographies of lincoln. That’s crazy! I do not think Lincoln knew that much about himself.
That’s funny!! And probably true!! He also read 186 historical nonfiction books!! That’s a lot of knowledge!
Yeah, I can barely read and here he is showing off reading that much@
I hear ya!! Jack London lived as a poor down and out pauper and still managed to write a book about exposing the gap between the rich and the poor. So there’s always hope!! Keep at your reading... and you’ll get better!
I hope! I have written a lot so I hope it all comes together!
I do too!!! Well, its been good talking to you. I have to get going. Have a great day. Goodbye!
You too!
Hello, what kind of genre do you prefer in books?
I prefer non fiction.  Although in fiction, I like mystery and drama.  What authors do you like?
I do not have a favorite author but I love the Harry Potter series.
I enjoyed the movie, Black Panther which was based on a Marvel Comics character.
I love all the movies of Harry Potter too! I love Black Panther. WAKANDA FOREVER!
The director of Black Panther also co-wrote it.  He must have earned some bucks.
I bet he earns a lot of money! That was a popular movie.
His name is Ryan Coogler.
Ryan Coogler? It made me think of cougar
One woman got a role in the movie and began her acting career at age 88. That’s old
I agree. Unless she has that energy.
Marvel started a studio to do the film.  They borrowed money and put their other characters up as collateral.  If the studio had failed, Merril Lynch would have owned Captain America and others.
I started liking Marvel after Spider Verse. That is crazy.
I grew up on DC comics, but Marvel has cut their own niche.  Denzel Washington helped Chadwick Boseman financially to study at Oxford 20 years ago.  That produced a great result.
What is your favorite DC comic?
I prefer Superman but Justice League is a close second.  He can turn back time by circling the earth.  The earth is the densest of the 4 terrestrial planets.
Have you watched Bumblebee? 
I don’t know what that is.  Enlighten me.
Have you heard of Transformers?
Of course.  They would certainly be in the genre of Sci-fi if they were in a book.
Bumble bee is that one yellow robot. That movie is all about him.
I see.  Guess I will go now.  
Good morning, are you a fan of standup comedy?
good morning. I am a little bit of a fan. Are you a fan?
Yes, I’ve been trying to go to a lot more shows lately. I recently saw Bill Burr and he was very funny.
That’s cool.  I like comedy movies and tv shows.  Have you ever seen 3rd rock from the sun?
I have watched a few episodes but I didn’t follow it closely? How about you?
I’ve seen a few. I heard it beat out Seinfeld, Friends, and even Frasier for the best comedy award in 1997.
That was a lot of great shows nominated at once. I watch a lot of Brooklyn Nine Nine now, I think that’s one of the best shows on TV.
I’ve never seen it but I have seen the commercials and it looks funny.  You are right about all those great shows.  Sounds like there was a lot of good comedy back in 1997.
It’s definitely not the same these days as it was back then. I think the rise of cable prices has hurt how many people are watching TV.
Speaking of cable tv. What do you think of comedy central?
I like Comedy Central, I haven’t watched it as much lately because I have been watching Netflix and Amazon Prime more.
Comedy Central may be very particular on how they do comedy.  I’ve heard they’ve canceled over 100 shows since they started back in 1989.
That’s a lot of shows to cancel. I know from watching Daniel Tosh’s show he would reference a show they canceled quickly each week.
Really?  I guess they are selective then.  i’ve never watched the channel. Do they do different types of comedy or just one?
They have a lot of original programming so they broadcast a wide variety of comedy. They also air original stand up comedy specials as well.
So have you ever seen ken jeong perform?
I have not seen him perform his stand up yet. He just released a new special on Netflix. I have only seen him in movies and on TV.
Yeah, i haven’t seen him either.  I heard he used to be a doctor of some kind.
Yes he was, it’s a pretty interesting career transition from being a doctor to being an actor.
Especially to a stand up comedian/actor.  I wonder what made him do it.
He must have really felt the calling to it. It was fun chatting about comedy with you, have a great day!
Have you ever had a seizure? I can’t believe that someone had a seizure at Ken Jeong’s comedy show!
I have never had one but i have seen people have them and yeah he thought it was a heckler thats pretty insane
I know! Crazy! I would have probably though the same. They said he ran right over to the person! 
Yeah he was an internal medicine practitioner before he turned to comedy so he attended to the woman until medics arrived
That is great. I heard that the audience members didn’t even record this. Amazing!
That is suprising considering how glued people are to their phones
I agree. I just hope most people are happy with how he reacted. That can be crazy!
I agree the audience met him with a round of applause when he returned to the stage.
So, Did you even realize that Comedy Central has cancelled over 100 shows since 1989??
no I did not realize that why are they cancelling so many shows? 
Personally it feels like it because so many people are so sensitive now. 
I agree with that I think people are way too sensitive now.. I liked all the shows that used to be on like 3rd Rock form the Sun it won the golden globe for best comedy series in 1997
I loved 3rd rock!  Are you into comics at all? I am not but my boys are.
I am a huge super hero nerd lol... I love the avengers marvel or dc comics idc I like it all lol
I don’t know know that much about it. Have you heard about the generic comic book?
Yeah Marvel published it in order to trademark the names of the heroes and villians
I had no idea what dc comics stands for? 
the dc stands for detective comics
Oh! I get that. Did you know that the Michigan State U library has the largest publicly available comic book collection!? 
I did not know that... I know that there are some that sell for a pretty penny
So good talking to you tonight!!
Hi! Do you watch any comedy?
Sometimes. What about you?
Yeah, though I have never seen any one perform live. Ken Jeong, the comedian is actually a licensed physician and even saved someone who had a seizure during his shows!
Oh wow he is a real doctor? I thought that was just a bit for tv. 
He actually went to medical school and did residency to become licensed, but I’m guessing he makes way more as a famous comedian than as a physician, what do you think?
That is crazy to think we live in a society where being famous can pay more than people whos job it is to save lives. 
Yeah, like I remember reading that the actor who plays Dr. House gets paid more than $700K per episode! I’m thinking doctor’s make about that in a year or something.
Wow that is just crazy amounts of money. But look at the budget for movies like avengers. Billions of dollars. 
Considering that Infinity War was the first film to ever be shot entirely with digital imax cameras, they probably needed that billion dollars.
Probably. Have to admit it though it made for one heck of a movie. 
Yeah! Was it because of the script or the all-star cast which included Robert Downey, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Benedict Cumberbatch, Christ Pratt?
I think the script. They have taken actors that were only sort of known and really put them on the map with these amazing scripts. 
Yeah, I agree but what I’m wondering is what the movie has to do with increase in shawarma sales, do you have any idea, did I miss something from the movie?
It has caused that? That is awesome! There is a scene at the end of the battle in new york where they all go for shawarma and are chilling around this table. It is iconic in the avengers universe. 
Oh! I really did miss it, thanks for clarifying! Crazy to think how the voice actor who plays Jarvis has never seen any of the films! Wouldn’t he be invited to the screening and stuff?
You would think. Isn’t he the guy that plays vision now?
Oh really? I don’t know, I’d have to read up on the books to know. Did you have read the comic books before watching the movies?
No I’ve never been much of a comic book reader. It sounds like there are some interesting storylines that could be turned into movies though. 
Yeah, me neither but it sure opens your mind to endless creativity like the universe takes place in earth 199999 years ago and there’s a multiverse too!
Stan lee was a visionary. He will be so missed. I can’t imagine not seeing his cameos in the coming movies. 
Yeah exactly and who’s going to end phone conversations with "excelsior" like he did.
Hello, are you a comedy fan?  Are you familiar with Ken Jeong’s
Not really but I have heard of the show The Hangover. Some comics are really brutal and I don’t like humor that hurts people.
He is actually a Dr.  He studied at Duke University.
That is interesting. I wonder why he went from medicine to humor? It’s a good thing because he saved the woman in the story.
Yes, I heard about this awhile back.  A women was having a seizure.  He first thought she was a heckler.
Hecklers are not funny at all. I went to a comedy show where there were several and they ruined the whole performance. I don’t think I could be a comedian you have to have a tough skin. He is good, though.
It is said that once he realized what was going on, he jumped off stage and into action.
I suspect that the training never leaves you. I would rather be a doctor but I guess he does really well acting. Comedy is a lot of fun if you don’t hurt other people with jokes.
I’m sure he makes more as a comedian and actor.  After his actions he told the crowd that he checked her vitals and reassured the crowd.  They applaued him.
I like The Three Stooges type of humor. Or Mr. Bean. I just watched one of his movies and I laughed all the way through. He makes fun of himself, mostly. And it hurts no one. 
Ken got his break in a comedy contest.  He then moved to LA and performed sets after long days in a HMO clinic.
That must have been difficult so he must have a real gift for comedy. I will have to check it out.’The empire strikes back’  was a comedy and I did not even know that. I need to keep up these movies.
YOU SHOULD DO THAT.  DID YOU KNOW THAT BILL MURRAY THINKS "KUNG FU HUSTLE" IS THE SUPREME ACHIVEMENT IN COMEDY?
I don’t know Kung Foo Hustle. Bill Murray is funny, though. I remember him on Saturday Night Live. Now that was funny. Especially Gilda Radner and Chevy Chase.
Bill Murray is an all time great.  I also saw that the Green Lantern movie was originally going to be a comedy with Jack Black.
The Greeks invented comedy as part of a dramatic performance. I would like to go back and see how funny they were compared to today’s comedians.
I didn’t know that.  Speaking of comedy and movies, The Avengers movie "Infinity War" was the first movie shot completely with digital imax cameras 
That’s another one I haven’t seen. That’s is interesting, though. I like the raven’s names Hugin and Munin.
I am a huge comic book fan.  Lou Ferrifno, who played the Hulk in the original 1670’s tv show has voiced him dor everything up until Avengers Age of Ultron
There were a lot of big starts doing the voices in the Avengers.  I like the Hulk. I always felt sorry for his character.
Yes, he is kind of sad.  Well have a Merry Christmas.
Good Morning! Have you ever heard of K-Pop?
K-pop is the music which is originated in South Korea, they are more popular in 2000.
I like how South Korea blasted K-Pop across the border to North Korea in 2010.
The north korea sank a south korean warship in 2010, south korea responded by blasting the k-pop song "hit your heart" across the border using large military loud speakers.
I bet that was very annoying to listen to all day and night! Did you know even Jackie Chan manages a K-Pop boy band?
Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, to make the movement repeat and well organised.
Speaking of choreography, ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of shows a week!
Ballet dance is originated in Italian Renaissance in the 15th century and it become concert dance in France and Russia.
I think it is cool that it’s still around to this day. Michael Jackson has some patents on some of his dance moves, crazy!
Dance is also represent the culture and traditional of particular region. Mostly it make our body well control and organised.
Even Tupac dance ballet in high school and performed in the production of the nutcracker.
Babies are dances immediately when they hear music and make their body very flexible.
I think it’s crazy how babies can do that. I can’t believe Bruce Lee was a dancer and was even in a dance championship in 1958!
It is very interesting. Dance is art, sometime other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have dance like quality, including martial arts and physical activity.
That is an awesome type of art! I think birds are a type of art as well, especially hummingbirds that steal spider webs for their own nests.
Birds are living world wide and there are more than ten thousand spices world wide. Birds have wings which developed more or less according to their species.
That is a lot of species! In most birds, their skeleton weighs less than their feathers!
So only it make to fly very high and far away. Some times birds travel from one continent to another continent for their breed.
They even go without sleeping during the migration!
Yeah. They no need of visa and other formalities.
They really don’t huh? Have a good day!
Hi, how are you?
Good. I learned a few fun facts. Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer as well as kung fu star and won the Hong Kong Cha-Cha championship in 1958.
That’s cool,never would have pictured him doing the Cha Cha but it takes the same skills probably to perform Kung Fu.
Other stars you would not expect, Tupac danced ballet and was the Mouse King in his high school production of the Nutcracker.
Wow, Tupac?  You must be pulling my leg!  Never could he be a ballet dancer.  Wow!
I know but creative people are drawn to the arts. Just like how babies are drawn to music. They will spontaneously dance when they hear music and smile when they hit the beat.
Speaking of ballet, did you know that ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week?
That is a lot of shoes. They must need it for all the extreme moves they perform. Kind of like Michael Jackson’s extreme lean that he has a patent on.
You’re probably right!
Some birds are so beautiful it is almost like they are dancing in flight. Hummingbirds are some of my favorites. Did you know they steal spiderwebs to build their nests?
Yes, birds are amazing.  Their bones are so hollow the fearthers weigh more than their skeletons.
That is fascinating. Some birds migrate from Alaska to Mexico without sleeping!
I wouldn’t make a good bird!  Couldn’t do that, at all.
Me either. I sometimes worry I would be like a dodo bird. They are in a sub-family of pigeon.
Lol, didn’t know that!  I read some wild Australian birds can mimic sounds like chainsaws and car alarms!
I find birds fascinating. They evolved wings and yet some lost the ability to fly like penguins. And then there are others that lived near water that became great at swimming.
If I was a bird, I hope I would have enough smarts to evolve to thrive in my environment.  Our poor birds today are struggling.  I’ve watched Canadian Geese all winter try to figure out when to head back North, only to hit a blizzard and have to turn around and fly back South.  It’s sad.
It is sad. They are such a great indicator species of our environment. Everything from the smallest 2 inch hummingbird to the 9 foot ostrich.
On a different note, have you ever heard of K pop?
I have and I was shocked to find out that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop boy band.
Wow, didn’t know that about Jackie. Well, it’s been nice chatting this morning.  Have a good Friday.
Do you like dogs?
I do, Im a dog person, what about you?
I like them though I don’t have one. Dogs and elephants are the only animals that can naturally understand pointing.
They are? I guess both are really smart dogs can also see color so thats something. 
Interesting. Always thought they were color blind. Google also prefers dogs to cats, so much that it is in their code of conduct.
And that’s why I love Google, that and also the fact that Google has saved my life many times lol
I feel bad for stray dogs sometimes. Istanbul has a vending machine that releases food and water for them if you recycle plastic bottles.
I guess those vending machines make a lot of doggies happy and also they help keep the streets clean. Its a win win situation I guess
yeah I think you’re right. Another good cause is doggy blood drives. However not sure how the dogs feel about that since they can’t consent. Haha.
There are 12 different types of bloods in dogs, how interesting is that
Interesting! What kind of dogs do you like?
I like small dogs, big dogs are high maintenance and scare others, what about you?
Yeah I love a little dog, especially one in a little sweater or a shirt! I’ve even seen one in a polo shirt. The polo shirt was actually invented for tennis, not polo!
Really always thought it was a polo things, shirts are part of our culture and I guess polo shirts are a classic now
Yeah, they were invented for tennis player Rene "the crocodile" Lacoste. Another shirt I like is the Hawaiian shirt. Have yet to see one on a dog. That’s the official business attire in Hawaii.
Oh so Lacoste was the inventor, thats really interesting, did you hear about Bill Mays funeral?
No, I haven’t hear about it.
Apparently the pallbearers wore Blue shirts in his funeral and also khaki pants. 
That is kind of cool. Speaking of cool, do you think Ugg boots are cool? They were invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the water.
I do wear them specially in the winter or when it rains I like to wear sport shoes better but boots can be comfy. 
Yeah, I like them too. I have cozy sweater looking ones for the house. It’s getting hot where I am already but we were blessed with another cool day. I’m going to go enjoy the evening, have a good one!
Hello there, are you a dog or a cat person?
I would have to say I am a cat person
I think I am a dog person, but I don’t mind cats.  Did you know dogs have 12 different blood types?
That is cool.  I heard they also have doggie blood drives too.
Yeah that is super cool!  Did you also know that dogs are not color blind like most people think?
Yeah, I heard that they can see colors, not as well as we do but still in color
They also, along with elephants, are the only two animals the seem to understand pointing by instincts. 
They are definitely mart animals.  That might by Google prefers them to cats.
That is so weird, and I guess they came out and declared they were a dog company. 
Yeah.  I dont know why, but that is how they identify.
Did you know that in Istanbul, they have a vending machine for stray dogs?
Yes!  It is such a cool concepts.  Recycle bottles for  dog food.  How neat!
Yeah I think that is really cool, and I know other countries around the world have big stray dog problems. 
I think even one place in Russia dogs are trained on using the subway.
That is incredible.  Did you know the dog was the first species to be domesticated?
Wow, I didn’t know that.  I would have thought it was cats.
Yeah I thought the same thing!
I wonder why dogs seem to chew on shoes so much.
Same here, I know I have had plenty of shoes torn up in my lifetime by dogs!
Did you know boots are a type of footwear and not a specific shoe?
No, I didn’t know that.  It was nice talking to you today, I hope you have a day!
Hello! Do you own any dogs?
I do!  I have one and have had one all my life since I was a kid.
Oh nice! Me too! Google even prefers dogs to cats lol.
Nice!  Some dogs in Moscow have learned to use the subway!
Well those dogs are definitely smarter than me lol. Dogs aren’t color blind either, just don’t see the same thing we see!
I wonder why they always have said they are? lol  I always find it amusing how a dog drinks with the underside of their tongue.
That is so cool. Dogs are so smart for sure! Dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.
Cool!  Russia has a tomb of the unknown dog as a memorial for canine research subjects.  Kind of sad.
It really is. I just love dogs haha. Did you know in Hawaii the office attire of choice is the aloha shirt? Talk about comfy!
Nice!  Sign me up!  lol  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shorts and khaki pants.  Kind of casual and different.
RIP Billy Mays! I like how polo shirts were originally invited for tennis players.
I didn’t know that!  I know the tshirt was invented in 1904 and was marketed to bachelors who couldn’t sew or replace buttons.
That would be the market I would have been in back then haha. I wish I would have invented the Ugg boots back then too haha.
Yes!  When we’re they created?"  I think they have been around since the 1800’s?
They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm on the beach after surfing!
Nice.  I’m thinking of a different boot then.  lol  The late musician Prince was a fantastic bowler and wore knee high furry boots while doing it.
That would have been a sight to see! The first person ever to be photographed was actually getting his boots cleaned.
I think I’ve read about that before and have seen the picture.  I think it was in Paris, France.
It was, and took place in 1838.
You should google it.  It’s pretty neat.  They are really tiny and didn’t know they were in the picture.
Will do! Have a good one!
Hi do you like to wear shirts?  I do!  I wear them every day.
I do.  I would be comfortable in Hawaii where the aloha shirt is official business attire.
Wouldn’t that be awesome to go to work like that!  At Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers all wore blue shirts and khaki pants.
Yeah, the "shirt" covers such a broad variety of garments that cover the upper body.  A shirt can also be worn as a necktie.
True.  I’ve used them over my head to keep the sun off me. lol
Is it proper to wear shirts and boots that match?
I would guess so? lol  Do you own a pair of Ugg boots?
I use to back when I was stationed in California and took up surfing.  They were actually invented by surfers to keep their feet warm after getting out of the ocean.
Nice.  I was going to ask if you lived by the ocean. I’ve never had any even though I live by Lake Michigan.  The Nokia company originally started making rubber boots in the 1800’s and they still make them to this day.
I use to live near Lake Michigan.  I have been to both oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. I don’t know if my Ugg boots would go well with my Hawaiian shirt.  What do you think? 
That’s awesome you’ve been able to see all those places.  The way I see it if you have the chance to where you can wear both at the same time, then go for it.  Life is about have fun right? lol
I suppose.  Talking about having fun.  Did you know that farmers use to put custom boots on their turkeys.  That’s just weird! lol
lol That’s funny.  I wonder if they did it so they wouldn’t get clawed?  My friend had chickens growing up and they had a rooster that was super mean and would go out of it’s way to try to claw you.
Need to see if that rooster could take out a dog!  Some roosters have pretty long spikes on their feet.
Oh yeah.  That sucker was mean let me tell you.  I think I would have a rabid dog chase me, which by the way dogs are not color blind!
We could call the bout a " Cock-a-Poodle-Do".  That was bad! lol.  I know dogs aren’t color blind but they don’t see as many colors as humans do.
LOL That’s funny!  Google prefers dogs over cats!  The wrote in their code of conduct that they are a dog company.  It’s been fun chatting with you!
Yeah, google is weird that way.  I am a cat person.  Nice talking with you.  Have a nice day!
Dogs and elephants are the only animals that instinctively understand pointing.  You have a nice day too!  Thanks for the chat!
I read that somewhere once.  lol
Cool!  Have a good day!
Hello, did you know the dodo bird is actual a sub-family of the pigeon.
I didn’t know that- of course I believe the bird is extinct, isn’t it?  This year we recently had a bunch of hummingbirds..that was a first for me and so exciting. SO TINY..
I also find it interesting that some birds can fly from alaska to north america without sleeping when they migrate.
Birds are very interesting because of a lot of facts.  I think it helps with their flight that their bones are hollow so not weighed down. 
Yes, they are interesting. I did not know that hummingbirds steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. I find that very interersting.
I have watched them pull some to make them nearby.  The way they flit about is so beautiful to watch.  It is almost elegant like a dance. ..performing art!
Yes, did you know that Jackie Chan manages a k-pop band. I did not know that but i think it’s cool.
It seems that so many you wouldn’t think to have other interests do.  Jackie in music, Bruce Lee in dancing.  A championship even!
It seems to be in a kpop band you have to be tough because they go through bootcamps before being signed.
Boot camps for bands.. Guess it takes a lot of stamina for the dancing and singing.  Kind of the same I would assume for figure skating.  Can you imagine the work to land a triple axel?
That is true. It looks hard. Did you know babies spontaneously dance when they hear music. They are cute.
Music is a wonderful thing, so much to come out of it.  Symbiotic relationship with dance and music. Tupac was able to do both- never would have thought ballet for him though.
Yes, that definitely does not fit his image. I was surprised that ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes a week. That is a lot.
The tip starts to break down and doesn’t hold form.  Same with skates, have to keep them sharp or can’t get the edge for spins and jumps. Would have to assume that Nagasu goes through a lot of skates for this reason.
I like that she wanted to do the triple axel so bad that she dreamed she could . That shows heart for wanting to do something.
Especially when she had been passed over for the previous Olympics.  Rippon omitted his quad jump at the start, not as much heart I guess.
And she is part of the record books for being the first U.S. lady to land triple axel in olympic competition.
She had her wish of making America proud.  Guess the same can’t be said for the Russians because of the prior doping scandal.
Yes, the doping scandal can be hard to come back from. It is amazing the amount of doping in sports today.
You would think that rather than compromising, like the Olympic committee did, they would just start to ban them.  Isn’t teaching them anything to allow certain numbers to still participate and medal.
That’s true. Did you know Michael Jackson had a patent on his leaning dance move.
I didn’t know that there was a device involved in it.  Wonder with his death if the patent transferred to someone?
Maybe it got passed down to his children.
He certainly was talented.  Wonder if he did his own choreography?
I think he did. He worked too hard and I think that is what caused his death. He had his whole family to take care of really.
So much control.  At least after he left Jackson 5 he had some freedom unlike the kids in K pop. Agencies controlling everything. Yikes!
That is true and to think K-pop had it’s first group of women in the 60’s is surprising. I thought k-pop was pretty new.
I was vaguely familiar with H.O.T. , Korean version of Backstreet Boys. Social networking and YouTube have launched a lot of the Korean Wave.
Yes and they have the loudest and most loyal fans.
I wonder if because they are now going global with this music if you will start to see fusion music.  Would mix well with Latin beats.
I like that when North korea sank a south korean warship they blasted the k-pop song hit your heart on loud speakers.
I wonder if that song was by their own K pop girl band, moranbong,  or if they selected it from someone else?
Moranbong  band was  the most popular music group in the country. They must have a lot of fans.
It is generally classified that way..K Pop.  Seems to have a more narrow sense of description and influence than back when they were around though.
And they say with social media and tv  shows  k-pop are gaining a widespread global audience.
To think that   different styles and genres of music can influence modern culture to such an extent as to become an "idol" like culture is mind boggling.
Yes, and I did not realize that when they are in bootcamp they are charged for everything. So when they make it famous they have to pay it all back.
Just like any other job, pay for the training.  Unfortunately in this instance the control extends beyond all the way to love lives, behavior and diets.  Not for me thank you.
It is like they control every part of their lives. That would  be very hard especially if they are young.
Maybe they will evolve, like the birds.  Sprout wings that give them flight.  Would think they would be more like an Ostrich or penguin in comparison..flightless.
I think so .
Do you like to dance? 
I do sometimes even though I am terrible haha. How about you?
I’m terrible also. Hilarious!
We should have taken lessons from Bruce Lee when we had the chance, or were alive way back then lol.
Yeah, I heard he was a great dancer. Apparently Tupac was pretty good too. 
Yea he portrayed the mouse king in a production of the nutcracker in high school for ballet!
Hilarious, I know he used to be a backup dancer for Digital Underground. 
Oh really? What an awesome fact! I know that when I was a baby, I would spontaneously dance (that’s what my parents said). It’s crazy how natural dancing is!
Hilarious. I didn’t know that babies did that. 
I wonder if they do it more listening to K-Pop? That’s the Korean music craze going on now!
Yeah, that is pretty funny. I’m not sure, MJ had a patent on dance moves though. 
I remember seeing a video on that. It allowed him to achieve an extreme lean on his dance moves?
yeah, that is pretty cool. What do you think about birds? 
I think birds are crazy lol. It’s cool their entire skeleton weights less than their feathers!
yeah, that is pretty cool isn’t it. What about hummingbirds, do you know anything about them? 
I know they steal spiderwebs to construct and repair their nests. When I get a spider web on me, I freak out lol.
That is pretty scary. I wonder what noises birds in australia make? 
I think they’ve learned to make sounds like cameras, car alarms, and chainsaws. That would be weird to hear huh?
Yeah, that is pretty weird isn’t it? I wonder if it is true. Well, nice chatting with you. 
I will have to check that out. Nice chatting with you as well!
Take it easy. 
Do you know why baseball manager wear the uniforms like the players do? 
I do!  They wear it because they are technically able to play for their tams if the need arises!  Baseball is a pretty popular sport in Japan.  
Yeah i hear they think it should be their pastime. I wonder if a manager has ever jumped into a game. 
They can if need be.  There are some major baseballs fans out there!
Yeah unfortunately I do not have the patience for it. Kickball is called soccer baseball in Canada. 
That’s a funny term in my opinion!  There was one person who found 3 million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic.  He  hit a gold mine!
Right, why can’t stuff like that happen to me, lol. Up until 2005 a married couple was responsible for scheduling all 2430 major league games. 
Dang that sounds like a busy life scheduling all that!  One thing I like from baseball is they get to wear hats.  Do you like hats?
Love hats, all kinds my friend. How about you? 
Yep I do also!  Fun little fact about in the Old West, the Cowboy hat was not the most popular.  The Bowler hat was, whichever that looks like!
Yeah police wear distinct hats usually peaked caps or brimmed hats, like the mounties. 
Yep their hats are noticeable!  Another fun fact I learned is a chefs funny hat they wear are called Toque!
Yeah that is a fun fact i did not know that. Some hats were worn for ceremonial purposes such as the mortarboard.
Ahh yes!  All this knowledge of hats!  Lol!  British politicians were mandated to wear a top hat if making a point of order in the house of commons until 1998!
Wow that good information. Do you know where tipping your hat originated from?  
Yep it just so happens to come from knights raising their face visors to show friendliness!
I think that’s really cool! In 1908 a law was passed limiting the length of the hatpins out of fear that suffragettes would use them as weapons. 
Wow sounded dangerous!  Did you know Dunce caps were worn to encourage foolish behavior?
Well that’s must be were the term originated. You know panda researcher wear panda suits to work. 
I did not know that, but sounds fun!  Any who, was nice chatting with ya!
You also have a great day!! In parting I tip my hat to you my friend.
Hello
Hello, how are you? Do you like baseball?
I enjoy it. It is such a fun fast paced game to watch. Do you like it?
I do enjoy baseball. There is nothing like going to a ball game. Did you know that the managers wear uniforms because they can technically can play if there is a need for it?
Really? I wouldn’t have guessed that looking at most of the managers. They don’t seem quite as in shape as most of the players on the team. 
Haha, I agree. It must be incase of injury or something. It’s a strange rule. Did you hear the story about the man who found a bunch of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfathers attic? They were worth 3 million dollars!
Oh man can you imagine going through stuff and all of sudden you come across a haul like that?! I would probably have a heart attack right then and there. 
I couldn’t even imagine, I would be so shocked. In japan baseball is very popular, and they are surprised to hear it;s status as america’s national pastime?
I wonder why they were surprised. Baseball has always been such a popular game here in the states. Maybe because we are so synonomous with football?
What is your favorite team?
I guess if I had to pick I would go with the twins. They are a pretty decent team. I wonder if there was any twins cards in that guys 3 million dollar find.
Maybe, that must of been so cool to find them.
I would be so excited to find something like that just sitting in my family’s attic. Since they were from the 40’s there had to be some amazing cards in there. 
Do you collect anything? I like to collect hats.
Not really unless kids costumes count. I always thought hats were super neat. They have such a long and rich history. 
Yes they do, tipping your hat origin is from when a knight raises their visors.
That is a neat fact! I love that people always associate the cowboy hat with the old west but really it was the bowler that was the favorite of the time. 
That is true. The party hat originates from dunce caps... they were worn at parties to encourage a more foolish behavior!
That is funny. I always thought of them as a punishment hat. Well it has been nice chatting with you have a good evening. 
You as well. Take care.
Bye
Hi, how are you doing today?
Good. Do you watch baseball? Back in August the nationals traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams before a game
Sometimes I follow baseball. Usually around playoffs. Did the Nationals make a mistake?
I don’t think so, they weren’t doing too good in the standings plus they’re stadium was half empty
I guess it was time to make a change, maybe rebuild.
Yea they weren’t doing too good, they were in third place in their division behind the Phillies
I think it’s tough to the lineup just right. Too many variables, and the team needs to gel as well.
Yea and the fans weren’t too happy with trading Daniel Murphy, guess he was a fan favorite
Did he sell enough tickets though? Probably most fans would want a winning team. 
Probably, they can always let their baseball manager play as they are technically allowed to play
That’s a funny rule, isn’t it. It must be a holdover from early days when a player also served as manager.
Yea, I remember back in the 1970s when Pete Rose was a manager he would sometimes play in the games too
Pete really was a competitive guy. He also bet against his team sometimes though. 
Yea that’s not good. I have old Pete Rose baseball cards but they’re not worth 3 million like the cards a man found in his grandfather’s attic
That guy must not have been able to believe his luck. I wonder what he did with the cards. I would have sold half and kept half. Money now, plus a long-term investment.
I’d take a trip to Japan where baseball is also very popular
The baseball there is just not as good as in the US. Still, it’s a difference experience at the stadium. It’s an interesting lesson in cultural difference.
I’d like to visit England too, it’s funny how until 1998 their politicians had to wear a top hat in the house of commons
I guess rules get held over for the sake of tradition. The old guard wants politicians in top hats and managers in player uniforms.
And Johnny Depp wears his Jack Sparrow costume to make visits to hospitals
He really does his best for the kids. I like that he’s willing to make some kid’s day better. 
He is a good person. Well I got to go, nice talking with you
do you like baseball?
Yes I do. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?
Yes because they can play of the team needs them to
Yeah. Do you know what kickball is called in Canada?
Yes it is called soccer-baseball
Yeah I guess it makes sense because it has elements from both games
Yeah true. Do you know who used to do the MLB schedule for 24 years?
Yes it was a couple who scheduled all games each year 
That is impressive. Do you wear hats at all?
sometimes. In the UK they hat to wear top hats to make a point in the House of COmmons
Cool. DO you know which was the most popular hat in the old west?
contrary to common belief it was not the cowboy hat but the bowler hat
I know right? Do you know where the tipping of the hat originated from
Yes that was from back then when the knights lifted their visors to show friendliness
Yeah. DO you know the origins of the conical party hat?
Yes that was from the dunce hat that encouraged foolish behavior 
Haha crazy. DO you know that panda researchers wear panda costumes?
Yes so pandas do not feel threatened I think. Did you know Sean Bean is scared of flying?
Yeah so much that he once hiked in a full costume to the filming site
WOw dedication and fear. Johnny Depp visits kids in hospitals wearing the Jack Sparrow costume
That must be so uplifting for the kids
Hello, how do you do?
hello, I’m alright!  Have you seen the new Christopher Robin movie?  I heard it was really for the whole family.  I remember seeing the trailer where Pooh goes, "They say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day!" I thought that line was funny.
I thought it was a clever adaptation of a classic that help the now older audience reconnect and relate in order to reconnect to their youth, perhaps having imaginary pals of their own
Hmm.. sometimes I think all my pals are imaginary.  Sadly, I’m told the REAL Christopher Robin (who the books were based on) hated them and never took any money from them.  I find that sad, since his father wrote the books for him..
That is a shame. I wonder why the real chris hated them. Perhaps he wanted a father to be there for him rather than children books
I think maybe he felt embarrassed because the books were based so heavily on his life.  Did you know he died on Easter in 1996?  That was one year after I graduated from high school.  Man, I feel old!  LOL
Well I hope he at least found some solace in that it inspired and that it is a indispensable part of many children worldwide
Yeah, hopefully.  Anyway, like I said, I haven’t seen it, I think I’ll check and see if my library has it though.  I would get it from Netflix, but I don’t have a subscription at the moment.  Are you on Netflix?  It’s pretty awesome! They’ve got like 137 million subscribers worldwide.
While I understand their business model and why people use it, I never got it. It is impressive nonetheless that they account for 33% of all bandwith in north america during peak hours
Yeah, I’ve heard they’re especially busy in the late hours.  Get this, they have an hour long movie that’s nothing but a roaring fireplace!  I think people play it a lot during the holidays or winter months to give their living rooms (or whatever) a decorative look.
I think that that is surprisingly practical for the ambiance. I bet blockbuster’s ghost regrets not buying netflix
Ha, yeah!  I’m told they laughed the Netflix people out of the office when they made an offer to them.  They regret that decision for sure!  
I mean if I could pay 50million today for 2 billion in a few years wow what an investment
Get this, Netflix has people on it’s staff who’s job is to watch the shows and tag the content (guessing with genre tags and stuff.)  Get PAID to watch Netflix?  Where do I sign up for that?  LOL
That does sound nice. I wonder if they will start outsourcing to us turkers?
Ha, we could only hope!  Course, if I had Netflix it wouldn’t be just for the movies and tv shows, I think I’d try some of their original programming as well.  For instance, I heard the show "Stranger Things" was really good. Have you seen that one?  
I have not, but I have heard good things about their original content lately.
Course, there’s so many subscription services it’s getting ridiculous.  Hulu, Amazon, Netflix, heck even Disney is coming out (or has it already?) with one for all their movies and properties.  
Well I mean they have to at least match up to their competitors so it is understandable. All that is left for consumers is to see who provides the best service
Yeah, but it must suck if several of them offer exclusively shows/movies that you REALLY to see.  When it was all just Netflix, you pretty much could get whatever you wanted... Did you know Disney makes $1,110 per SECOND?  Wow... that blows my mind.
That is amazing. Disney sure has come a long way and while you don’t really think of disney as a media company and more of a amusement park and animation studio, it is the largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue
I think it’s crazy when you think about just how much STUFF they own now.  I mean, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, the theme parks.  It’s like they’re trying to completely take over the world!  (laughs nervously)
I agree it is the time of big corporations. I wonder if the tv show where the earth is ruled by corporations instead of countries will come to pass? In any case, thank you for the wonderful chat.
hi friend
Hello! Hope you’re having a good day.
thank you friend do you like this topic
Do you mean the film Christopher Robin? I enjoyed it very much. Have you seen it?
iam really enjoyed for chat for you and you happy  chating for me
Thank you! I find it fascinating that the original Winnie-the-Pooh books were based on a real boy, the author’s son. Did you know that?
yes i know this books is so great
I agree! And I loved how the Christopher Robin movie brought the characters to live through a mix of live action and computer animation.
yes in this book is so interesting character also and nice book
Do you have a favorite Winnie-the-Pooh character?
is good k tell for you boring character for this book 
That’s fine. We can’t all like the same things, right? My favorite is Eeyore.
yes l like you answer
Thank you! Hey, did you know the Christopher Robin movie was made by The Walt Disney Company?
OK you most favorite for other anyone books
Sure! I know Disney publishes a lot of books every year, too. It’s a huge corporation.
i like some Disney books
What are some of your favorites?
iam always  like  action story is my favorite 
I enjoy action stories, too. Do you like action movies as well? I’ve seen some great ones on Netflix.
yes i watch for more than action movies for Netflix 
I really love Netflix’s streaming service. It’s so convenient! What’s the last movie you watched on Netflix?
yes you are really correct friend Netflix is good for always
Absolutely. Hey, friend, I’ve got to run, but it was great talking to you!
thank you friend i really happy for talking for you
Hope you have a great day! Bye!
Do you enjoy movies?
Yes, I do.  Do you?
Do you usually watch them on netflix or at the theater?
I used to watch movies at the theater a lot, but nowadays it’s usually on Netflix.
What you watched any walt disney films of late?
I recently watched Christopher Robin with Ewan McGregor.  Have you seen it?
I heard about it. Christopher Robin is the adult version of winnie the pooh right?
Yeah, that’s the one.  Ewan McGregor is Christopher Robin as an adult.  But he ends up going back to the land that Winnie the Pooh and Tiger and all of them live in.
I think it’s plot sounds wonderful for not only children, but also adults to reconnect with their childhoods in a similar manner
Yeah.  It was pretty nostalgic for me since I used to love Winnie the Pooh as a kid.  It was fun.  I recommend it, if you’re interested.
Sweet. It is too bad the real christopher robin disliked winnie the pooh
Is that true?  I hadn’t heard about that.
Ya I guess he felt it was too close to his real life and perhaps he would rather have a father than a child’s story
Wow!  That’s really interesting!  I can understand that.  Unfortunately, the movie didn’t really address any of that.  That would have been cool to know as just a side bit of info while watching.
Well regardless of how the real Christoper felt, it is hard to deny the place of winnie the pooh in the hearts of millions of children and adults today
True.  Disney really hit it big getting to make that movie.  
Well disney has always done a good job in making great movies that are appealing to both children and adults
Yeah for sure.  Mickey and Minerva Mouse have sure laid the groundwork for many decades of great entertainment!
True. I mean there is even a whole subculture dedicated to finding the hidden mickey mouse references in all things disney
Do you think there actually is Mickey in every disney film?  Do you think that applies to Pixar too?
Yes I do. People love their easter eggs. In any case, thanks for taking the time to chat.
Hi. how are you, this morning?
I’m doing well, how are you? Do you have kids, if so do you watch Cupcake and Dino? 
Doing good, thanks.  No kids here, but what is Cupcake and Dino?
Apparently it is a kids show, but I’ve never seen it. Maybe it is a movie. 
Have you seen the Christopher Robin film?  I was wondering how it was.
No, I didn’t. It sounds like it could have been good Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor. 
Yes, he is.  I didn’t go see it, because I thought people would look at me strange seeing a "kids" movie.  But I always liked Winnie the Pooh, as a child.
It was a good show. Did you know Christopher Robin was a real boy? 
I heard that he was the author’s son in real life.  That’s so cool, talk about having a book written about you.
I don’t know if I could handle that to be honest.
Me either. Lol The New York public library is the home of the real Winnie the pooh toy teddy bear.  I saw it once on a school trip, it looked old and raggedy.
I didn’t know that. So they still have it? 
Yes, they do. It’s hard to believe that toy bear hasn’t fallen apart, yet. It’s like WW I era, that’s old. 
That’s pretty cool. I wonder if they offer the movie on Netflix? 
They probably do, I’m going to look for it and watch it, if they do.
Apparently netflix and youtube make up half of peak internet traffic in north america. 
That I can totally see.  And the other half is on Facebook.. lol
I believe it, although you have to wonder how much of that is actually instagram? 
How true.  I heard that Blockbuster had several chances to buy Netflix and didn’t.  Big mistake on their part.
I believe it, although you don’t know if they would have ran it as successfully. 
That’s true.  Well, it’s been nice talking with you, I’ll see you around.
Hi there, do you enjoy poetry?
No I really don’t.I don’t understand it and find it boring.
Oh I see. Some of them can be cool though, like that poem that when read normally is depressing and vice versa
there is a 274 line poem called the chaos, i am assuming becaus it has irregularly pronounced words
I would assume so too. THe Javanese alphabet too, if recited in order it forms a poem
the vikings were warrior poets. lol what the heck? did they just shout poetry at the enemy ?
Hahaha maybe that is how they fought. Allan Poe received only $9 for his poem The Raven. Not is is priceless
isn’t that always the way? things don’t become priceless until the person is dead. baltimore must be the place for poetry! first edgar allen poe and also tupac 
Yeah it seems that way. On another topic, do you like dogs?
Lol these really arent my favorite subjects. I am not a dog fan.
Oh I see. But just for curiosity, they have 12 blood types, way more than we do
they can also reason better than chimps
Seem lie it since they understand pointing, same as elephants
they enjoy solving a problem
Yeah that too. Even Google has declared itself as a dog company
im guessing with that they allow employees to bring dogs to work? I can’t ever figure out what makes them a dog compnay
Well maybe and they have it in their code of conduct that they are a dog company
russia must really be into dogs they have a tomb of the unknown dog AND some of their dogs have learned to use the subway
Wow that is impressive. For a long time I thought that dogs were colorblind but apprently they just do not see as many colors as we do
and they can learn over 1000 words. I guess thats why they make them service dogs
Yeah, it makes sense. Nice chat
Which city is home to Netflix?
I’ve heard it’s from Los Gatos in California. Do you use Netflix?
Yes.    I heard they have a lot of users worldwide.    Do you know how many?
I don’t, but I use it to watch a few shows. What kind of stuff do you watch on it?
I love the movie Apollo 13 on netflix.    Can you believe that film inspired the whole service!
No kidding? I had no idea! It’s amazing what good cinematography can inspire in others.
Nothing to do with the film, but founder Reed Hastings forgot to return a VHS tape and got $40 in late fees and wanted to do something about it!
Hah, I guess cinematography isn’t everything. I think we all know how he must have felt getting a late fee. If only everyone were as determined to do something about frustrations!
True.    I do like cinematography though.     It is amazing what can come from a lens and light.
Cinematography is so fascinating. It’s like an intersection of physics and visual art, because of all the dependence on understanding how light and lenses work.
True, but it is also about technology - how the sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel.
I can’t pretend to understand all the technology behind it. It’s like magic in a way.
OK.    I guess ultimately it is about the people behind it, like James Wong Howe who won an Oscar.
Do you know what movie he won for?
I do not know, but he frequently used a crab dolly and deep-focus cinematography to create his style.
I wonder why some people have such a gift for cinematography. They seem to be able to picture things in their minds that make such a visual impact even though others wouldn’t imagine it beforehand.
Very True.     Stanley Kubrick had a vision and took the camera from his cinematographer, but allowed him to keep the credit.
I would be awfully annoyed if I were that cinematographer, haha. First I can’t do my job, then I get credit for something I didn’t even do!
I suppose, but the oscar and residuals from Spartacus probably help!
That’s true. I wouldn’t mind getting paid for not having to do my job either, and as a cinematographer, he probably had a lot of appreciation for seeing Oscar-worthy work done in front of him by Kubrick.
Perhaps the Internet Movie Database IMDb should create a new category for things like this!
That would be a great new addition. I use IMDB to look up moves and actors/actresses all the time.
Have you seen Kevin Spacey in the "Billionaire Boys Club" movie?
I haven’t seen it, actually. Is it any good?
I haven’t. I heard that it’s opening was a career low opening day total for Spacey, though. It’s because of all the bad accusations against him, I think.
I saw him in the movie Baby Driver, but the accusations are definitely a deterrent for some people with how widespread #MeToo has become
Yes, I actually haven’t seen him in a movie since American Beauty. I watch movies on Netflix sometimes. Do you?
I have to be in the mood since I like to read and listen to a lot of books. I tend to create a watchlist on Netflix faster than I can watch things, but I like how convenient it is. I can’t imagine having to rent movies from Blockbuster
Netflix is really popular now. I hear it accounts for a third of all the bandwidth in North America during late night.
I think the shows and movies help people unwind now, and there’s no commercial breaks. Combined with YouTube, the two account for half the bandwidth in North America
I hear Netflix actually spends more on postage than on bandwidth. The owner started the company after being annoyed by a late fee of his VHS movie rental.
I would be annoyed about a rental fee that’s higher than it costs for the VHS. It’s still strange to think that people still use the rental service, but I guess internet connection isn’t always the best in some places
Yes I think maybe it’s from parents getting stuff for their kids to watch while they can watch streaming Netflix at the same time.
Netflix is capable of streaming on more than one device at the same time depending on the subscription. Either way, it’s still better than if Blockbuster had bought Netflix
Of course. I think some wifi can’t handle that, though. Yes, I heard they actually turned down buying Netflix. It was for much lower of a price than it’s worth now, too!
I think their value went up once they started creating their own content. It’s part of the appeal now to keep users loyal
Yes, Netflix creating their own content seems like it’s part of a cinematography revolution or something!
Maybe if they team up with cinematographer Roger Deakins, his 14th nomination for the Oscars will be the one that finally wins. Losing 13 times would be hard
Yes, that would be hard. On the bright side, I bet not many cinematographers have been putting out such mention worthy work for so many years!
Not since James Wong Howe back in the 1940s. He was Chinese before finally becoming a citizen, but he used techniques such as low lighting and wide-angle lenses before it was popular
Sounds like a very talented and revolutionary cinematographer. One of my favorites is Stanely Kubrick. He did Spartacus.
I’ve heard of him, though he didn’t get the credit for his work. Sounds like a stand-up guy though
Well I guess he’s usually considered a producer, but he did a lot of the work on Spartacus. He is a cool guy...you should look up an interview of his.
Have you ever been on a blind date?
No but I heard blind dates can be quite successful and lead to marriage
I did too and people rate them on a 1-5 scale. Do you think people care about their date’s shoes?
I think women tend to care more about the shoes then men, men tend to only care more about function than style
Did you know that professional ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week? I hope they’re not too expensive!
That’s insane. I just learned they have Wizard of Oz inspired shoes that can guide you home when you click you heels
That’s pretty cool! I like that Steve Smith leaves his cleats every game to make people aware of the homeless without shoes.
Yea, that is very thoughtful. Did you know in the 9th century Persian Cavalry soldiers wore high-heeled shoes>
I can’t imagine soldiers in high heels! Another thing I can’t imagine because it’s portrayed differently is that pilgrims wore tons of colorful clothes and black only for special occasions?
I never knew that but there are still African tribes that wear old Victorian clothing so anythings possible
Me either.  Did you know Apple had a clothing line 1986? I thought they only did technology...
Well there are some odd clothing compaines, Miguel Cabarello makes bulletproof clothings
I wonder if that is extra heavy? I would love to visit the store in Alabama that sells clothes etc from unclaimed baggage at the airport. I bet there’s some interesting things.
Speaking of airport clothing, a man in China once wore 70 clothing items just to avoid bagging fees
Well the fees are getting high on some airlines! I wonder how much it happens that a label says made somewhere, but is really made elsewhere like with Rip Curl?
Probably a lot. Did you know at Billy Mays funeral the pallbearers wore blue shirts and khakis?
I would love to see a gang in America layer shirts with popped collars like they did in China!
Lol, sounds better than Mark Zuckerburgs plain shirts that cost $300-$400
That’s crazy! It would be nice to have business attire be an aloha shirt like in Hawaii. I would be much more comfortable.
Yea that sounds much more comfortable than a blue shirt and khakis
I agree! Have a great night!
Hello,  do you like shoes?
I do, only have a few pairs but I do like them, what about you?
Yes,  I love shoes.  Did you know ballet dancers go through 4 pairs of shoes a week!
I didnt, the must spend a fortune in shoes, there are 17 wayts to tie shoes!!
wow,  I only know 3 lol 
I know the one lol, do you remember Bill Nye the science guy?
Yeah definitely!
Ok so apparently he holds a patent for ballet pointe shoes, seems like he is a fan of ballet or just a science guy that stumbled into a great invention
wow really.  that seems weird lol did you know putting dry tea bads in smelly shoes or gm bads will absorb the unpleasant odor. This actually works really well, we put it in our snowboard boots lol 
Yeah that sounds really weird, do you keep up with fashion? 
not really lol I just buy whatever looks good on me. 
I see, well Tshirts were invented back in 1904,directed to bachelors actually
Oh really that is interesting. The official business attire in hawaii is that aloha shirt. 
That is interesting as well, do you know Mark Zuckerberg, he always wears grey shirts, they seem simple but they actually cost around 300-400 dollars each
lol no I didnt I havent noticed. 
They seem like a regular $10 t-shirt but yeah they are worth a lot of money, 
Thats interesting,  maybe he like a certain brand or whatever.  Did you know Polo shirts were invented for tennis players?
Really? by tennis players? the name doesnt serve them justice, Polo takes all the credit lol
lol so weird right
I know right, did you know a chinese man wore 70 items of clothing to avoid the bagging charge, that must have been funny to watch
Wow I wonder how much the baggage charge wouldve been lol that doesnt seem worth it.  
Maybe he had no money left lol, sounds like a lot of trouble only to avoid paying a fee, there is bulletproof clothing called mogul
Its been good chatting. 
How are you today.
Well thank you. Do you have any hobbies?
Funny you mention it i use to write a little poetry. how about you?
I used to do a little poetry in high school, learning about allusions, symbolism, and all the other poetry jargon. 
Wow that’s taking me back. Poetry dates back to prehistoric times.
Poetry was first written by the Greeks I believe. Perhaps earlier, but I don’t think we have any other ancient written works dating prior
The earliest western poetry was written in Sumerian. 
Was it as complex then as today? Using rhyme, rhetoric, and other literary devices?
One was called the Epic of Sundiata an example of griot court poetry. This was in Africa. 
Writing poetry is definitely an art. For instance, there is poem that when read normally is depressing, yet backwards it is inspiring. Perhaps embodying the silver lining to a negative situation.
Wow i would like to read that one. There is an alphabet that when recited in order forms a poem. I for get which one.
To this day poetry influenced our perceptions. For instance, all the hobbit’s character names are derived from the poem dvergatal
Now that i did not know. Do you like dogs?
Who doesn’t? I think that humans can bond with most animals, even crocs, but the level of intimacy is different from that of dogs since dogs and humans have evolved side by side to be better attuned to one another
I agree for instance did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types and they donate blood?
I did. I was surprised I never thought about animals donating bird before I learned that fact
Apparently google prefers dogs to cats.
Then I wonder if employees can bring their dogs to work every day?
Apparently they’ve even written it into their code of conduct.
Well I guess Google simply acknowledges that dogs are man’s best friend
I always believed that dogs were color blind but that’s not entirely true. 
I think they can only see less colors like blue and yellow
Yeah they can’t see as many colors as we can. Nice chatting with you.
Hi, how are you?
Im great, do you know who Mariah Carey is?
I do. Do you like her music?
Yeah she has some decent songs, Glitter is one of my favorites and  Pet Semaraty is also good
Did you ever see her "Cribs" episode on MTV? She is super-extra!
No I didnt catch that episode, so do you like Pop music?
I do like pop music. Did you know Ariana Grande got hit by a puck twice in one game?
I didn’t know that, that is odd lol, twice in a game? she must have a puck magnet in her forehead.
Yeah, it just was on twitter or Apple news this past weekend. There’s a picture of her sitting on a zamboni too!
I guess there’s a lot of controversy because of that, do you like snakes?
No. I hate snakes. I mean irrational hate! Do you?
I have a healthy respect for them and would scream like a little girl if I ever saw one next to me lol, they are interesting animals though
My 7 year old asked if he could get one and I tried to act cool, like I wasn’t completely afraid of the notion! I was cool as a cucumber...
And did you bought you r7 year old a snake lol?
Nope! He got a cat. And I hate that thing. It’s the worst cat ever. He just scratches and pees everywhere. JERK!
I agree im more of a dog person myself, maybe a snake was a better choice I would be afraid but I wouldnt worry about scratches and pee
Yeah. She is going to a farm in the spring. That’s not code. OUr friend has a farm and some barn cats so she will be relocated there.
I see, well interesting fact about snakes, sometimes they are born with two heads and both head end up fighting for food.
That’s really weird. Bite the head to spite the stomach!
Yeah and also 70% of the snakes lay eggs others give live birth another surprising fact.
Gross. Nice chatting with you!
Do you listen to Mariah Carey? 
I do, I have been a fan of the All I want for Christmas is You.  
That was a good album. I’m not sure if she has released anything recently though.
I dont know either, she does have an incredible vocal range though.  No other singer really has matched her there.
Do you think she will go on tour soon? 
I’m not sure, but I know Glitter has gone to the top of the charts recently
Is that her new album? I wonder if it is doing better than Linkin Parks Hybrid theory.
It is one of hers, but not better than Linkin Park’s that was the best selling album of all time.
Apparently, NWA’s album was the first to reach platinum status without the support of airplay. 
That is pretty incredible, now musicians have it much easier as distribution of music is easier, you dont have to go to the store to buy things anymore.
Yeah, with Youtube and things like that. Do you own any snakes? 
Nope.  Im like New Zeland, no snakes.  But I do have some friends who own them.
Interesting, I didn’t know there were no snakes in new Zealand. 
Im now sure why, maybe all the other animals ate them or something.  Have you heard of those flying snakes that can launch themselves at their prey?  That would be totally creepy
No, do they have wings? 
I dont know, all that I imagine is kind of like this cartoon character I saw once, Trogdor, That is what I think of.  
Well, did you know there are legless lizards that aren’t snakes? 
Really?  Thats kind of crazy.  I wonder if they have the paired organs like snakes do.
I’m not sure, but at least they don’t fly like some snakes!
If I ever ran into one of those flying snakes I dont know what I would do.  The fear of snakes is hard wired into both human and monkey brains.
Yeah, they can be scary looking creatures, that is for sure. 
Hey there!  Are you a Beatles fan?
Good evening, why yes, I am.  Are you?
Who was your favorite Beatle?  Think I like Ringo just ’cause he’s kinda goofy.
George Harrison was my favorite.
Cool.  Most people tend to say John or Paul.  Probably because they were the primary songwriters.  You have a favorite song?
She loves you, Yeah, yeah, yeah!  Only because we played it while I was in Junior High band and we thought we were cool!
One of the songs I like is "Come Together." Did you know it was actually written for Timothy Leary’s 1969 California governor campaign?  
I didn’t know that.  Interesting.
Another one I like is A Hard Days Night.  Think I relate to the line that goes "And I’ve been working like a dog." 1) Because I’m overworked and 2) because I’m a dog person. You like dogs?
Yes, I am a dog person.  Good segue, by the way.  I have 2.  Do you have any?
Don’t have any but my kids keep bugging me for one.  They keep reminding me "they’re man’s best friend!" Thinking that will make me think it’ll be easier to take care of.  What kind of dogs do you have?
I have a 12 year old yellow lab and a 10 year old yorkie/ poodle mix and they are the best and are truly man’s best friend!
How good are they at taking directions?  Heard that dogs and elephants are the only animals that understand pointing.
Both of them are very smart and understand pointing and are better behaved than many children I see in stores.
Ha!  My husband use to volunteer for an organization that trained service dogs for aiding the disabled.  Think they were labradoodles.  He said they were very smart.  
I used to think that my dogs saw in black and white but i have since learned that they aren’t color blind and in fact can see colors, just not as many as a human.
That’s pretty interesting.  Wonder what colors they can see!  My daughter so desperately wants a dog she spent an afternoon writing a poem about why she deserves a dog.  A for effort. Lots of rhyming like Dr. Seuss.  
Oh, get that baby a doggie.  Every kid needs a dog, it’ll help teach her responsibility and accountability. Speaking of poetry, do you like it?
Yeah, those were some of her arguments.  Kinda dreaded learning the classics.  I remember having to memorize The Raven.
Funny, I remember that one, as well as Anabelle Lee.  You know Edgar Allan Poe only got $9.00 for The Raven?
Dang!  No wonder he wrote a lot of depressing stuff. Great chatting with you.  Give your dogs a hug for me and I’ll consider getting my kids a dog.  Take care!
You too, friend.  Enjoy the rest of your night!
Hey, do you care a lot about fashion? 
Yes I know a lot about clothing actually. In fact I’m wearing some right now LOL what about you
I know a decent amount although I do not care the most about fashion. Did you know that Apple had a clothing line back in 1986?
No I didn’t know that. I wonder what those clothes look like? They’re probably very colorful like the pilgrims original clothes, not the black clothes that they wore for special occasions
I wonder what apples clothing line looked like too. And speaking of Pilgrims, I thought that it was the exact opposite as what you said. I guess it is just me.
A lot of things are the opposite of what you would think. Like how ripcurl says on their clothes that they are made in China when in fact they are made in North Korea
I am not suprised that they tried to keep that a secret. I do not think anyone would buy something that was made in North Korea!
Nope I definitely would not! I also wouldn’t buy clothes from unclaimed baggage, there’s a store in Alabama that actually sells that stuff
Really? I would not trust that store. Professional Ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week!
That is impressive! How often do you wear shoes by the way? I want to try on the shoes that are 5000 years old and actually perform better than current shoes
I am sure that those shoes are also much, much more expensive to manufacture although trying them on would be a pretty neat experience
They probably smell bad because they’re so old, we should put dry tea bags inside of them because that will absorb the odor LOL
I do not think that is the best idea..... It would probably damage the shoes. Maybe spraying it with bottle of febreeze would be better...
Speaking of clothes, what do you think about shirts? Did you know that you can wear a necktie under the collar with a dress shirt? I do that for work
I occasionally do that. The pallbearers wore blue shirts and khaki pants to billy mays funeral. Disrespectful much?
Haha that is either very disrespectful or very respectful LOL. I wish I lived in Hawaii though, you can wear an Aloha shirt instead of a suit and tie there
That is probably because it is much warmer there. Nevertheless, I also wish that I could show up to work in a random t-shirt!
Yep I agree with you! I think it’s cool that the polo shirt was not invented by a polo player, but was actually invented by a tennis player, very interesting
I wonder why it was called the polo shirt then, shouldn’t it be called the ’tennis shirt’? Although that does sound quite weird
Yes I think Polo sounds better haha. Also interesting that the man who invented that shirt was nicknamed the crocodile and that’s why polo shirts have that crocodile logo on them
Ah. China’s cultural revolution gang revolved around layering as many shirts as humanly possible
I wonder what that looked like! are you aware of the difference between a button up and a button down shirt?
DO you like poetry?
I love it. Have you read the poem Chaos?
I have not, what is it about?
It is a poem with 800 irregularly pronounced words and it has 274 lines
WOw that is awesome. Have you heard of that poem that is different when read normally and the backwards?
I cannot say that I have, how different?
Normally read is depressive and backwards is inspiring 
WOw cool. Do you know who CS LEwis and TOlkien are?
Yes they are both great authors from their time
Yes and they had you laugh you lose games over bad poetry
WOw that must have been hard for them to keep from laughing
True. Did you know art and poetry were olympic sports?
Nice, that is cool. Do you like dogs?
I love dogs. They can learn up to 1000 words
Nice and they also understand pointing like elephants do too
Yes and they also are better at reasoning than the chimps
Nice, They also have 12 different blood types and have blood drives
Nice. They drink with their underside of the tongue
Wow neat. Google have it in their code of conduct that they are a dog company
SO cool. Nice chatting with you
Same here
Hi partner, what type of shoes do you like?
I like all kinds of shoes. I prefer shoes that are more fashionable. But, I haven’t been able to afford them in recent years. 
What type of shoes do you think best for protecting one’s feet?
I think any shoes with good soles are the best for protecting your feet. You need good support. 
I have little arch in my feet and I am seeking comfortable shoes. Do you have any suggesting?
I think the higher end shoes have better support in the soles. But, if you can’t afford better shoes, you can always add sole supports in the shoes. 
Yes, I agree, I am referring to steel toe work shoes. Would you spend $15.00 to have a piece placed under your shoes?
No, I don’t think so. I think many steel toed shoes already have the pieces in place. 
Another question, did you know that a tea bag can absorb unpleasant odor in shoes?
No, I didn’t. But they can remove smells from gym bags, too. That’s a good way to get those smells out. I used to wipe mine out with a Lysol wipe. 
Would you wear clothes made from animal skin?
I wear leather shoes, and they are made of animal skin...so I guess the answer is yes. Would you?
Yes, if it’s made from leather, but I had to wear clothes with gator skin. I guess it’s a mind game with me.
It seems people think it is acceptable to wear some clothes from certain types of animal skin but not others. It always reminds me of the movie 101 Dalmatians. Did you see that movie?
I saw about 15 minutes, but I didn’t get the understanding of the movie.
I really liked the movie. The main point of the movie was that Cruella DeVille was trying to make a coat out of puppies. 
Ok, I don’t mind killing animals for food, but I dislike killing for clothes, when there are many other material used to make clothes.
What is your favorite kind of fabric?
Cotton is my favorite fabric. I think about 85% of our clothes are made from cotton.
I like cotton a lot, too. I’m not a big polyester fan. I feel that the fabric feels fake. Also, it scares me that my clothes could be flammable. 
You are right. I agree with you.
Can you believe that there is a store in Alabama that only sells clothes found in unclaimed airport baggage? That’s weird.
Yes, that is weird, to sell clothes worn by don’t know who or whom these clothes belongs to. 
Exactly! You never know what happened in those clothes. That’s what I always say about clothes at "vintage stores," too. You don’t know what happened in children’s clothes...especially the pants. 
These are all the questions I have for you, thanks
Thank you. Nice talking with you! 
Thanks
hi
Hi, how are you?  Are you a music fan?
i am good...
yes i am a music fan
Me too.  Do you ever listen to things on LP?  
Yes...... when i was in clg
I still have one at home and some of my grandfathers old records, but for most of my music I ve moved in to the 20th Centruy and gone with CDs and mostly MP3.
thats amazing...... 
Do you have a favorite album?
castle of glass, my favorite 
Im a big fan of Dream Theater’s recent work The Astonishing.  It doesnt quite hold up to NWA’s work or Dark side of the moon in terms of popularity, but I like it.
thats great..... i listen to their songs abut to be quiet frank i dont know them as you do........
They are a little more obscure, kind of like Ricky Gervais, who was actually a pop singer in the 80’s.  I had no clue about that.
best music was from the 80’s.... all kinds...... wish we were born then.
Very true, a study from 2012 even proves music has become more similar in terms of musical construction since the 60’s.
thats good news....... but nothing to beat a classic
Like We are the Champions being voted the catchiest pop song ever.  I cant think of a person who hasnt heard that one.
Queen i a legend like he used to mention...... lots of his songs are my energy boosters
Freddie is probably one of the most iconic singers of all time.  All of their music is just fantastic.  The new stuff, even the k-pop band  Moranbong Band, which is top in Korea doesnt hold a candle to what was done in the 80-90’s
absolutely....... songs  like another one bites the dust, Crazy little thing called love, i want to break free, we will rock you and of course bohemian rhapsody .... legendry
I find it hard to believe Linkin Parks "hybrid theory" is the best selling album of the 21st century.
its really good , paper cut, with you,  runaway...... good songs
I like their music.  I think it is really neat that NWA Straight outta compton was the first album to ever go platinum, and that is with out airplay or a major tour to support it.
I agree...... they are good.
Well, I must get going.  It has been nice chatting with you today.
same here.....
hello, do you use netflix?
Hello, yes I do! Sometimes I use the hour long fireplace video at home. Do you like Netflix too?
I love netflix, so many shows and movies in there. Do you remember blockbuster?
I do! I wonder if Netflix and Blockbuster ever could have done a partnership or something like that.
Well Blockbuster had the chance to buy it and passed on it. bad decision
Definitely a terrible decision, now Netflix has all these great selections. Last I checked they have almost 150 movies with perfect ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.
Yesh for sure, and they offerd it to blockbuster for only $50 million
That would have been a steal for sure. I wonder how much Netflix pays their taggers, who have to watch and label the content.
Hmm good question. Do you know how netflix came about?
I believe they started off with DVD sales and rentals, and eventually transitioned into streaming media. I wonder how they improve technology from here.
Yeah and then the owner of netflix was fine $40 for a late fee and got sick of it
It’s interesting how people get inspiration for things. IMDb is actually older than the first web browsers on the internet.
That is truly very cool. Did you know netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america?
I never knew that! I wonder if it’s similar for other TV/movie platforms. Are you interested in cinematography in general?
Yeah I am. Do you know who pioneered the wide-angle cameras?
I am not sure actually, I know Nicolas Rehn was a pioneer in high-contrast cinematography to see what’s happening on screen.
The guy who pioneered it was the chinese-american James WOng
Ahh ok, it certainly must have been a significant achievement. Are you interested in film ratings? I use review sites a lot.
Yes I like to refer to IMDb. How about you?
I do too, although sometimes they can be inaccurate. Shawshank redemption wasn’t very commercially successful yet it’s one of their highest rated films ever.
Yeah, you never know , right? Nice chatting with you.
hey there what do you think of planet earth?
It’s a nice place. I’ve lived there my whole life. I’m pretty attached. What about you?
haha ya me too, sad to think that 80% of the natural forests have been destroyed though
Only 20% more to go! We are a destructive species. Can seem to protect things that we need to survive. And we’ve been here just a short time.
thats true, if history were a 24 hour day, humans have only taken up about 1 minute of time
The day has been getting longer. It was only 5.5 hours. Soon it’ll be so long that we’ll have a 20-hour workday. I bet people will want more vacation. 
that is wacky, will the day continue to get longer? like a 40 hour day at somepoint?
Maybe in billions of years. Humanity will be long gone, having cut down all the forests and filled the oceans with plastic.
ya that is sad to think about, also sad we’ll have run out of helium by the year 2100
We’ll get our helium from fusion reactors. Every kid can have party balloons.
haha well I hope so. It’s pretty silly there is an ambassador to extraterrestrials at the UN, I want his job
I think you have to know somebody. It sounds like it involves few duties. Mostly waiting.
haha ya, lots of waiting and doing nothihng, have you ever ridden a horse
Nope, never ridden a horse. Haven’t eaten one either.
haha nope I have ridden one, I guess they evolved over like 50 million years
They went from multi-toed to single-toed. I guess they were more useful to humans that way.
ya I think so, they became really widespread about 3000BC, so kind of a long time
Interspecies utility is interesting. Dalmatians are associated with firefighting because they would calm  the horses.
that’s nice of them. did you knw clint eastwood was allergic to horses?
Yeah, he acquired an allergy later in life. Very odd.
would you ride a horse to school?
Earth is amazing don’t you think? So much history in its 4.5 billion years of creation.
I think it is amazing! Not only the composition and history of earth, but also its position relative to other planets in the solar system.
I agree, so many wonders to think we only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds on a 24 hour calendar of Earth’s history.
What do you mean?
I mean that if 4.5 billion years of histoy equals 24 hours then humans have only exist for 1 minute and 17 seconds of that 24 hour period,
Oh wow! That is really neat, time really does fly! I really appreciate these tech billionaire’s efforts into space exploration, like Elon Musk and his bold initiative to start colonization in Mars.
I heard he wants to build a supersonic vertical take off jet.
Whatever that is, it just sounds super cool! I wonder how he finds time the to do all these things, he’s the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, chairman of SolarCity. It makes me seem very unproductive
I know it seems like he wouldnt have much time, he is also an actor and producer, seems like he has more than 24 hours in his day.
He is an actor and producer? I didn’t know that, do you know which movies/TV shows he is involved with?
He’s in a production called "Thank you for smoking"; I haven’t seen it either though.
That seems a little ironic for his recent ordeal with smoking marijuana during an interview with the host and was fined, I think. His wife or ex-wife also appeared in Christopher Nolan’s film, Inception.
Thats Elon Musk’s wife? I didnt know that!  she is a good actress.
I’m not sure which character she played, but according to the article, she appeared in it. I wonder if that movie inspired him to create any of his companies.
Could be, so anyway, do you like horses?
Yes, but I would never ride a horse to school like what two high school students did on the "no vehicles to school day", very creative though
I agree, really creative for sure, I bet they got in a lot of trouble too.
Yes, they were suspended, which seems a little harsh to me.
It does seem harsh but then again the horses could lose control and create a lof of chaos.
Yes, especially if they had brought Icelandic horses, which have a fifth speed, called the tolt, which is a speedwalking unit for a horse
Can you imagine all the chaos? Another cool fact is that Clint Easthood is allergic to horses.
Hi, how are you? Do like horses?
Hey there I love horses. Even though I’m allergic to them they are still very fun to ride, what do you think
You’re allergic? Are you Clint Eastwood? LOL. I’ve never ridden a horse, but they seem like majestic animals.
I wish I were Clint Eastwood! But I never knew that Iceland actually has a specific horses with a fifth speed, other horses do not have this ability for some reason
I don’t understand the speeds. Trot, gallop, ??? What else is there?
yes its something called Tolt, I don’t know exactly how fast that is though lol
I guess they have used horses there for many purposes. What do you think of the two high school students who rode their horses to school on ’no vehicles to school day’, and got suspended?
I think that was genius but pretty dumb that they got suspended haha. What do you think about Dalmatians? Do you know how they are related to horses
I know that they are used by firefighters. I heard that they were deaf or something.
Yes a lot of them are actually deaf. What do you think about Elon Musk by the way? I know that’s a change of topic haha
That is a change of topic. He is not a dalmatian, or a horse, or deaf. I think that he is ambitious and trying to create new technology. You?
Yes he seems very smart and also very ambitious. I think he has a dog but it’s not a Dalmatian though haha. His wife also appeared in the movie Inception by the way
I thought he got divorced? Is he still married? She must be pretty.
I think he is still married. I’m not sure what she looks like though, did you ever watch the movie thank you for smoking by the way?
Yes, I did. A long time ago. An interesting film. I like Aaron whatshisname. 
Yes I did like that movie, Elon Musk apparently produced it and I forgot that he acted in it too
I’ll have to check for that. He is a talented, intelligent guy. 
Yep absolutely. I love that he wants to create a vertical take-off jet, that also is electric, I think that would be cool I would love to have that haha
His ideas are astronomical. Anyway, great chat! Have a good night! Go watch Thanks for Smoking again.
Yes I’m going to check it out very soon, I’m going to keep my eyes peeled for Elon Musk haha. also I’ll keep my eyes peeled for his rocket that will colonize Mars haha
Yes, I will wait for Elon to travel on it first though before I go. Talk to you soon!
sounds good, I’ll be waiting for Spacex!
Earth never stops to amaze me, it was formed over 4.5 billion years ago and there is still much to learn about our planet
I know what you mean.  It is the only object known to have life and we need to know why that is.
I agree, we must find life in other planets if we want to survive as a species, its sad how 80% of the forests have been destroyed by now
That is definitely sad and very troubling.  It makes me wonder what will happen to the polar regions with all of the ice.
Global Warming happened to them and if we dont start caring about our planet we might need to find another one soon.
Already things are changing.  Did you know that there will be no helium on the planet by the end of this century?  Not only are we losing plants and animals but now we are losing elements.
I did not know that, I wonder how that will affect us, im sure it will have hidden consequences on life on earth and to think we account to only a small portion of earths history
I imagine it will have consequences too.  I’ve heard that when the earth was first formed a day was only just over 5 hours long.  That would be weird.  I guess that means the planet used to be closer to the sun?
Yeah, it seems that way, or maybe rotated at a bigger speed, you know we  have an embassador in case aliens arrive to the planet or try to make contact with us.
I didn’t know that!  That’s actually pretty cool!  I hope he or she is friends with Elon Musk. At the rate he is going, he’ll find life before the government does.  He’s already planning a colony on Mars.
Elon Musk is a genious, hopefully he is successful with his colonisation plan, he is also an actor you know
I didn’t know that.  I knew he co founded paypal but I had no idea he acted as well.
Yeah apparently he acted in a thank you for smoking sketch, and his wife is an actress as well she was in the movie Inception
Impressive.  I like that he is into solar energy.  He inspired a solar company and now it’s part of Tesla.
He is looking into the future that is for sure, he also wanted to build a vertical take off jet for passangers.
That would be different. I wonder if it would have benefits that the normal way doesn’t.  You know he thinks outside the box.  When he wants to do something he just does it, like shooting a cheese wheel into space.
That is an absurd way to waste money lol, shooting a cheese wheel into space! amazing but at the same time wasteful.
If you got it why not?  He is worth over 20 billion dollars after all.
Yeah I guess so, just seems like a waste with all the poor families and kids without homes in the world, to think Musk was born in 1971, he sure has taken advantage of his time on earth
He really has.  I think he can be inspiring.  I can see how it could be wasteful to spend money like that but on the other hand he shows people to just do what they want with what they have.  It’s a lot like Galileo back in the day building a telescope.  To me it’s a way to say give your imagination free reign and try stuff.  Tesla is an electronic car company that he founded in the day and age where the big automakers dominate but he is giving it a try.
Yeah I guess his contributions to socitety are bigger, one day he will be remembered as Galileo and other historic figures.
Have you ever seen the movie Snowden
Not yet. I know that’s about the whistle blower who escaped to Russia, right? 
Yeah founder of Wikileaks. You know they published the government’s plans to destroy them. 
That’s right. I forgot that he found Wikileaks also. I didn’t know that, but I recently learned that the government owns 86% of NV land.
That’s a lot of land to be own by the government, what’s their game plan, lol
Maybe Snowden knows! Apparently governments are to abide by governing principles that are to balance individual freedom and tyranny.
Yeah sounds suspect. In 2006, the us passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva conventions
Also sounds suspect. Did you know that Albert Einstein was asked to be Israel’s president? But he declined.
That’s deep. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to invite Albert Einstein to the White House. 
Yeah, and the letter was intercepted and then the invitation was declined by Flexner.
Sounds like another administration i can think of. 
Einstein was very involved in American politics. To this day, his estate earns $18 million annually.
He was born in Germany right?
Yes, but he was very worldly. He was also a member of the NAACP and he charged $1 for his autograph. All of that collected money was donated to charities.
Well that doesn’t sound too bad. This is strange though Albert einstein wrote a quote in 1938 and placed it in a time capsule to be opened in 6939.
6939. I wonder why so far into the future. He was a scientist and developed the theory of relativity so maybe he saw something happening in this distant future.
Maybe, thats too far in the future for me. It was not until the 19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and historian of science William Whewell in 1833. 
Just a little too far ha-ha. And natural philosophy was a precursor of natural science.
They say that Harrison schmitt was the only scientist to walk on the moon.
Einstein would have been in all his glory if he had the chance. And it would have been well deserved since he wrote to Roosevelt about uranium being turned into bombs.
Yeah he did a lot more than what he’s best known for  mass energy equivalence formula E = mc2
Eureka! He sure did. But anyway, I enjoyed our chat! It was very informative. I hope you have a great evening.
you too!
Take care!
Are you a science fan? did you know that the estate of Einstein earns more that 18,000,000 a year? Pretty amazing inventor!
I do love science. There is so many cool things to explore such as computers or chemistry. 
Did you know that Albert Einstein was born in Germany and is best known for for his equation E= mc2?
I did know that. I find it intersting he wrote to Roosevelt about nuclear energy so long ago. We tend to think of it as a modern thing beyond the A bomb
It seems ironic that scientist put men on the moon but Harrison Schmitt was the only one to actually walk on the moon.
I think astronauts need a different temperment than someone who works in a lab or engineering. There has to be a sense of thrill seeking that seems to be lacking in a lot of scientists. 
So true. The world wide web was invented in 1989 by and english scientist working in Switzerland for a state funded research organization. . .How much it changed the world!
It really has! I think it has impacted our economy and countries in ways that are unimaginable. I wonder if they knew what they were inventing when they did it.
I am sure they had no idea! There were two geniuses that invented things without thought of how they were to be used Hertz and Maxwell.  Had this thought that curiosity shoud drive invention
I think curiousity is a great thing. The internet sure has helped with that. Imagine the information we have access to now that generations past had so much trouble accessing. 
So often only governments and universities can fund the research for projects in science without an immediate need. It is kind of like an essay in Harpers magazine in 1939 titled "The usefulness of Useless Knowledge.
If only that money was put to better use.
It is a bit like the scientist Hertz that worked out electromagnetism. Macaroni, did very little of the science but he was credited with inventing radio! 
I think the pointless project funding goes back to entitlement spending. People start to think they can spend just because they want to. 
I think that was on the tails of the industrial revolution. I think that know with spending out of control only endowed universities have the luxury of funding research without a product goal.
The problems lie in the facts that it is doing nothing but driving us deeper into debt as federal funding goes to these pointless projects that are driven in the name of research for research’s sake and has no practical value. 
That is so true now. In the days of the 30s, 40s, and fifties, the inventions such as dishwashers, air conditioners, and fax machines would drive the economy up.
I think if we were to address the cost of inflation and the realities of what our government has done to the economy vs what other countries are doing we would be in a better place as a nation in america. 
I don’t think that we would have the luxuries in our homes and lives that we have now without scientist. as a sidenote, did you know that Einstein answered his own mail? 
I could see that. He seemed like a very down to earth man for how brilliant he was. 
That he could do that and earn the Nobel Prize for Physics shows that he was somewhat down to earth.
He was a brilliant and kind man who impacted the science community in so many ways. 
Hello, do you follow the government?
A little bit, they own almost all of Nevada. 
Yep, they own 86% of the state which is crazy.
They did test a lot of nuclear bombs there, so I don’t think anyone would want those areas. 
Very good point. Did you know Wikileaks published the government’s plan to shutdown Wikileaks?
No, but it is seems logical given the nature of government and Wikileak’s nature to publish them.  
True. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice. 
Yeah, I feel a little bad for the people that fell for it, especially the first one, he was so ashamed that he did not called to police. 
Me too. The Norwegian government once gave $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. 
Do you think they will succeed ? I hope so. 
I hope so too. Do you know much about Einstein?
I know he was a scientist. Is he German ?
Yep, he was German. He was once asked to be the president of Israel. 
Why would they ask him to be president of Israel ? He must have made a ton of money with all those posters with his face. 
Not really sure. I also saw he was a member of the NAACP.
So he was actively for civics right, he seems a good man but a quirky one I have heard that he wrote something and put it is a time capsule that will be opened in 6939.  
He was a good man and very smart. That’s cool about the time capsule. Did you know he would charge $1 for his autograph?
That is a lot for the time, what did he do with the money ?
Not really sure lol. Seems a little bizarre. It was good chatting with you!
Good, but there are other interesting scientists to talk about like the emperor of Japan who is also a scientist. 
That’s good. Take care!
How do you think our government is doing?
Hi, I think they are doing pretty good right now. What do you think?
I think so too, lots of drama with it, but as long as they are doing their job I am fine with it
For sure. I saw Wikileaks once published the government’s plan to shutdown Wikileaks.
that is awesome, that is really sticking it to the man. I wonder if they released why 86% of Nevada is owned by the government
That’s a lot of Nevada they own. I bet there are tons of secret bases and things like that out there.
I am sure there has to be. It is all desert, but I am sure they are doing some crazy things there
I bet they are. In 2008, the Norwegian government donated $1 billion to help save the Amazon rainforest. 
Wow, that is something! I wish we did that but I think we donate billions already to other countries with aid. 
Yes we do donate a lot. A man in France once impersonated a government official and was able to sell the Eiffel Tower twice
that is awesome! not once, but twice! Someone had to have gotten fired over it lol
I agree. Do you know much about Einstein?
I know he was some super smart guy and scientist. I think his estate gets a ton of money still
He was very smart. Looks like his estate gets $18,000,000 annually. 
wow that is a ton of money, literally! I wonder what for. I am sure he has a ton of patents
I bet. Einstein was a member of the NAACP.
that is awesome, he didn’t discriminate. He lived during those times. I think he was asked to be the president of Israel also once
That’s pretty cool. Did you know he charged $1 for his autograph?
that is awesome! I hope he donated the money to charity or something. It was nice chatting with you!
It was good chatting with you too. Did you know the emperor of Japan is a scientist as well?
wow that is pretty crazy stuff! What a smart dude! Enjoy your day!
Hi there! Do you think voting is important?
No today i don’t, sorry i think it’s all rigged.What about you? 
Yeah, sadly, I feel the same. Maybe the system still needs to be developed. Up until 1918 not all men in UK had the vote.
Right i heard that. Did you know astronauts get to vote from space? 
Neat! And in India they even set up a voting booth for one voter in area saturated with lions.
Guess they did want him to vote. That sounds unusually cruel. 
I wonder if in India they vote what to name their garbage dumps. In Austin, Texas they voted to name theirs after Fred Durst.
Wow that is to funny, i wonder why? Another unfortunate fact is that 34% of black males will never have the chance to vote
That’s sad. And a lot of eligible voters do not show up. The turnout for presidential elections has not reached 63 percent in the last 100 years.
Right! heres an interesting fact since 1900 the taller candidate has always won.
Wow! So officials in Ancient Athens were appointed by lottery. They thought elections would cause oligarchy. And knowing the fact you just told me doesn’t make me have faith in the system either!
It’ supposed to be a formal group decision making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office. We know it;s not. 
Do you think they should add a none of these candidates voting option for all elections?
I’m on the fence about that. I know Nevada has it but i wonder what the benefits are beside knowing who voted and who didn’t.
Yeah, there needs to be electoral reform, so that fair electorial systems are put in place.
Right i’m with you. Did you know that one of the moons of Jupiter would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun?
Wow. Speaking of planets, I was sad when Pluto was deemed not a planet! I grew up being taught that it was!
I know and then all of a sudden right! I hear they discovered building block for life some 455 light years away. I wonder how? 
Yeah, I’m not sure. And I always thought planets spun in a similar manner. Venus doesn’t tilt so it has no seasons, and it also rotates clock wise unlike other planets.
Wow! Hey there a five planets in our solar system that can be seen with the naked eye.
Cool, I want to go out right now and see how many I can spot. Have a good night!
Planets are pretty crazy if  you think about it
Yes, they are. I am crazy enough to appreciate them though. What interesting facts about planets do you know?
Jupiter’s moon ganymede would be a planet if it orbited the sun, do you know any?
I have heard that some planets dont have a tilted axis, and others spin on their SIDE. crazy, huh?
wow, very crazy, what would earth be like spinning on its side lol. I heard Uranus rolls around the sun
URANUS? <chuckle> What a name! Yes, i wonder what is wrong with that planet besides its awkward name.
Right lol! imagine a planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at you, that is a real thing
that sounds like a terrible vacation. i would rather go that planet 455 light years away.
right, I heard about that planet, it can possible sustain life right?
It might. we should get Elon to get some people headed toward the thing.
Right, that could be his next venture. You think we will see a man on mars in our lifetime?
Yes, we will, but how long can they be there? and what can they do that a probe cant? 
That is a valid point, I am glad someone is spending money on it. Do you think the Space Force will patrol it lol?
Um, i dont know about the Space Force. Maybe? THe govt has 22 trillion in debt. it is not a popular idea at the moment. 
I think our elected president will push it like the wall, are you a fan of him?
I am not really a trump fan. the wall is going to be in the next budget. about 8 billion. i think that the 2020 election is going to be interesting.
I think so too, I wonder who he will run against. I think if he wins it will show it was rigged again, but that is my opinion
The democratic field is a jumble now. it is unclear how the dems will come up with someone to run against an incumbent.
I agree, there seems like there is already 20 running and I have only heard of like 4 of them. I need to research more. It was so nice chatting with you!
It has been great! Im glad that the system is up again! Have a good evening!
I am too, I hope it lasts! Have a good evening also!
hi, did you vote in the last election?
Hi, how are you? Which election? 2018?
The 2016 one?
Yes, I did vote. Did you vote?
Yes of course. Did you know the indian government put a poll in a forested area full of lions for a single voter?
I guess the gov’t needs to make sure everyone has a chance to vote. The US is different. The voter turnout for presidential elections hasn’t exceeded 62.8% in the last 100 years
I cannot believe more people do not get out and vote, teally
They probably feel that their options are poor. Except in Nevada.Nevada is the only state to have the "none of these candidates" voting option for presidential elections
I like to have that option really. Did you know astronauts vote from space?
I figure they have the right. I wonder what percentage of astronauts actually vote.
Maybe all of them I hope. even in uk not al men had the right to vote until 1918
Maybe you needed to own land, or have a title or something. I wonder if the same rules applied to women.
I am not sure, but glad we all get to vote now. Did you know in atlanta 34% of the black male population cannot vote?
That sounds like the South. I wonder what would happen if a basketball player ran for president.Since 1900, the taller candidate has won the us presidential election 75% of the time.
That is an interesting one. In ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery
I guess they didn’t want rich people to have power. Randomness changes things up.
I guess, but it seems it worked well for them. Do you know much about the planet?
The one that I’m on right now? Sure, I know a few things. 
Well all of them I guess Like that planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways at 4500 mpg on 2000 fahrenehit weather
I think you’d better bring an umbrella. Anyhoo, thanks for the chat!
same here, have a good one
What did you think of the article about the shootings in Parkland
I thought it was very thoughtful and sad about all the mass shootings around in FL and Las Vegas
I thought it was sad too. It’s a shame that people have to resort to shooting students as well as teachers. It’s not even safe to go to school anymore
I wish there could be non-polarizing discussions on it between society and politicians
There needs to be a conversation about it. Maybe it will reach out to people and the shootings will stop. Parents shouldn’t have to worry about what’s going to happen to their children when they send them to school.
I guess it’s important to vote for politicians who care about the people they represent and not lobbyists or the party line
Exactly. All certain politicians care about is money.They don’t care about what is best for people. If they did, things would be better and maybe the violence would end.
Yep, in ancient athens officials were appointed by lottery to avoid an oligarchy
Maybe that should be done here in the U.S. Most likely Trump wouldn’t be in office if the elections was done by lottery.
No, unfortunitly voter turnout hasn’t breached 62.8% in the last 100 years so that may be why the country is in such bad shape
You’re probably right. Some people feel like their vote doesn’t count so they don’t bother. Then again, maybe the taller candidate won as the article claims. That does explain how certain people are elected
I think Nevada has it right with the option "none of the candidates" as a voting option
I think they have it right too. It gives you the option not to vote for people you don’t think are good enough to be in office
People vote for interesting things, Austin TX voted to rename their garbage dump to Fred Durst
They really do. I wonder why they wanted to name it after him. I also wonder why all men couldn’t vote until 1918
I don’t know, I also don’t know why there are polling booths in forests filled of lions in India
I don’t know why there are polling booths like that either. It also never occurred to me that astronauts can vote from space
That’s nuts. Jupiter’s moon ganymede would be considered a planet if it orbited the sun
It is. I find it strange how venus doesn’t have seasons
Yea, Uranus is strange too since it rotates sideways
Exactly. That is very strange. Just like the planet where shards of glass precipitate sideways
Shards of glass and 2000 degree weather, sounds fun
Hi, how are you?
I’m great! How are you?
Well, thanks! How is your smelling ability
It’s pretty good, on par will most. I still can synthesize my own vitamin C.
How is your hearing?
Hearing is pretty good. Like most humans, I have excellent distant running abilities. Well, maybe I used to.
There is a sound frequency that causes fear in humans! That seems weird...
I think it’s 13 hertz, very low, below our threshold of hearing. Causes fear because I think it’s like an earthquake sound.
Reallly??? That’s impressive knowledge! Do you know anything about ribs
I’ve read that they grow back stronger after they get broken, but I haven’t tested that out myself.
Yeah. I know if you smoke them with BBQ sauce for 2 hours on 180 they are delicious...
That a good tip, but they probably won’t heal well after that. 
No, I am not good for the healing portion of ribs. I am on the other side of the healing line. I wonder how many ribs a black swallower fish can eat...
Times times their weight? They would get kicked out of the smorgasbord.
Yeah! They would do some damage... I wonder how they would consume water?
I don’t know whether they are freshwater or saltwater fish. 
That would make the difference. I kknow they do not have necks...
The humble seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. But it’s not immortal!
Is there anything that is immortal, besides Hulk Hogan?
There is a breed of jellyfish that’s immortal. Probably goes by the nickname "Hulk Hogan."
HA! Nice chatting with you!
It is amazing how a certain scent can ellict specific memories from throughout your life isn’t it?
I know, I can catch a faint smell of something and be reminded of something from 20 years ago.
Yes, like a summer rain always reminds me of walking through the woods as a boy.  It’s too bad we can’t replicate those scents and be reminded of our childhood all of the time.
I’ve never thought about it, but I suppose we don’t have names for smells, just where it comes from.
That’s true I refer to a damp basement smell as moldy but why not refer to the smell of onions as ’yuk’?
It’s difficult to imagine having names for each smell, as we have for colors.  I’d think there were too many.
Yes, but imagine if the defining term could relate to the listener not only what the smell was precisely but perhaps even it’s location. Maybe other languages allow for more descriptive labels.
I suppose if you have to survive, partially because of your nose, it makes sense to be very specific.
I would think so. I suppose it has validity to convey something with just one word that lets everyone know everything about it. I think it might be difficult if you were to use a smell word with someone who had never smelled that scent before.
The Semaq Beri speakers take it seriously, especially with the brother and sister thing.  They’d struggle in the city.
Ha! They would indeed. It is funny how different cultures have taboos that make no sense to anyone but them. Whenever I smell a certain perfume I find myself back in time to my school days and the girl I used to love.
I guess we have the ability to use our noses in the same way, we just don’t have the need.  There’s not the peril for us.
True. Not many wild predators around to threaten us. It might be interesting to know their names for smells and try to correlate them into our culture, would they mean the same or not.
It seems it very specific to what you do, like the difference between horticulturists and hunter-gatherers.
Yes, and culture. If I say to you that an object smells like (.......), you would in all likelihood have a very good idea of what I’m referring to based on shared experience.
Avoiding mixing odors seems very extreme, I can’t imagine cooking at home if I have to use different burner for each meat.
That would indeed be a hardship. When I cook I’m always using the simplest most direct way to get fed. A lot of the time that involves a can and one pot.
I wonder what they’d make of some of the exotic cuisines like Indian, Thai or Vietnamese cooking.
They would be adding to their dictionary I think. Some smells give me the willies, like fish. I hate the smell so whenever I walk into someone’s home that has been cooking it I get sick to my stomach, so maybe they are on to something when they don’t mix odors. 
Speaking of fish, did you know there was an immortal jellyfish?
I heard that but wonder how they determined it?
Yeah, I guess there is no way to prove it.  A lot easier to prove a seahorse has  a neck
Yes. Maybe the jellyfish in question regenerates itself constantly so they just infer that it’s immortal.
Another surprising fact is the burning of books by the FDA, I thought the US was against censorship
I did too. What was the subject matter and when did it happen?
I have no idea, I’d guess the thirties or fifties.  Some kinds of novels with problematic themes
Probably of a sexual nature. Many people seem to think that leads to corruption.
Well, it was good speaking to you.
Hello! Do you like to read?
Hi, yes I like to read both Fiction and not fiction, what about you?
I’m into non-fiction more than anything. I wonder what types of books the FDA burned back then.
Wow, they really did a big act of censorship, it was six tons of books
That is one big stack of books! I wish I could have watched the olympic events of literature back in the day!
That is right along with music and painting!! And it was until last centuries!!
That is so crazy! I didn’t even know romantic kissing was a fairly recent development in literature! Where have I been!
Wow, And it was not mentioned frequently in greek literature
Those stories were still amazing though even without that haha. I wonder if they ever wrote about humans losing their body hair 240,000 years ago?
LOL who knows!! but I found crazy that there is  a contest to come up with the worst opening sentence of a novel
I’m sure there have been many dandies! I bet Winston Churchill wasn’t in that since he won a nobel prize in literature.
Yes he did not earn a peace nobel prize!
You would have thought that is what it was for! I sometimes wonder what sound frequency causes fear in us?
Wow, I guess they use those frequencies in suspense and terror movies! but did you know we could re-grow a rib
That is crazy that we can! I wish we could regrow hair lol, and vitamin C but we can’t, but everything else can!
That would be awesome! The rib we could grow in 2 to 3 months, there must be something to regrow hair, we just have to discover it!
I agree! We need to get on the immortal life like a breed of jellyfish is!
That is amazing! and about sea creatures, did you know only the seahorse has a neck?
That is hard to imagine with all of the breeds out there, but very cool! Fish are just crazy!
Did you know that there is a difference how fresh water and salt water fishes drink water?
Isn’t it something with osmosis? I’m going to look more into that. Have a great day!
How familiar are you with the hunting and gathering culture people used to have?
Not too familiar,      Although I’ve read a bit from researcher Nicole Kruspe discussing odor.
Although our sense of smell may not be as developed as some species, odor played an essential role in our survival. However, odor is unique in that people don’t name the specific odor itself, but rather what it reminds us of.
Interesting.   Western scholars dismissed scents as unknowable, or at least unnameable for millenia.
True, but recent studies by Majid found that the Jahai, who are hunter gatherers still, are able to identify these odors by abstract names. It seems that these hunter gathers & horticulturalists can identify odors, unlike the rest of their world due to their unique cirucmstances.
True, Kruspe and Majid propose that, when people settle into, say, horticulture or postindustrial society, other senses become relatively more important than smell. 
McGann states that this ability to distinguish the differences in odor receptors would play a greater role in a more natural, wild environment than the secure urban areas that most horicultural people live. While distinquishing complex smells may save a hunter/gather’s life in the wild, it would be as much a life or death situation in most instances in an urban setting. In fact, simple odors like smelling sulfur are enough for most people to avoid dangerous situations.
Did you know that Humans (taxonomically, Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina.
I recently read that the defining characteristics of Hominina are bipedal locomotion, high dexterity, complex brains, and complex language.
Early hominins‚ particularly the australopithecines, whose brains and anatomy are in many ways more similar to ancestral non-human apes‚ are less often referred to as "human."
True, but because evolutionary development is progressive, it is diffiult to define cleanly where it is apes stop being apes and became humans instead. Considering some of these early hominins were capable of using fire, displaying high intelligence, I believe they should still be consider humans or at least an early precusor.
True, they gave rise to anatomically modern Homo sapiens in Africa about 315,000 years ago
Rather than simply anatomy, I believe the social behaviors and communication is what distinguishes modern human. While most early hominins were capable of using tools, homo sapiens were able to use societys for protection and use their advance communication to capture even the most abstract of concepts for the exponential accumulation and spread of knowledge.
Did you know that If earth’s entire history was viewed as a 24 hour period, humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds.
I only happened upon that information on a Did you know? video. What advantages do you believe allowed us to dominate within this small window in history?
Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a relatively larger brain with a particularly well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex which enable high levels of abstract reasoning and language
Although early hominins have similar adaptations, what do you believe made us stand out and survive while the others didn’t?
A silly one is that Humans are the only mammals that can’t breathe and swallow at the same time
What purpose do you think this serves? Is it to seperate the lungs and stomach to prevent drowning or getting food in the lungs?
Perhaps so, although such adaptaptations would be more likely to occur as gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits came to land.
Speaking of fish, I recently learned that it is negatively labeled as a parphyletic group and not a formal taxonoic group since the classification isn’t as clear as perhaps mammals.
Fish are pretty amazing.      There was a koi fish named hanako that lived for 226 years    Thanks for the chat!
Do you like fish?
Yes, I love fish (at least eating it). I find it funny that freshwater fish only "drink" water through their skin via osmosis, while saltwater fish also drink water through their mouths.
I like to eat them too, and that is funny, have you heard of the black swallower fish before?
Well, I’ve heard that they can eat prey twice their length and ten times their weight, so they must be quite strong. 
I agree and also a scary species, they seem like quite the predator
Yeah, for sure! I also found it interesting that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I didn’t even know it was a kind of fish.
The only one? reallly? that is suprising I though most fish had a neck
Actually, I think what we take for a fish’s neck (I’ve made this mistake also) is not really a neck, but more the area where their gills come out. I find it interesting also that 84 per cent of genes known to be associated with human diseases have counterparts in the zebrafish.
Sounds like a fish we have to study a lot more closely, they can be the solution to many of our health problems and the immortal jellyfish
Yeah, for sure! It’s kind of funny actually, because they said that in humans, that if a human has a rib surgically shortened, that he/she can regrow a rib equally as strong as the original within only 2-3 months.
Humans are just amazing, we adapt for persistnace and we are the best distance runners in all the animal kingdom
Yeah, for sure! Humans do have their downfalls though, because they cannot synthesize their own vitamin c like animals and plants can.
I guess its a great thing we know how to appy science, 
Yeah, for sure! One thing that humans have going for them however is their creativity. Did you know that there is an annual literature contest that challenges writers to come up with the worst possible opening sentence to a novel? That’s really funny. 
I didnt know that, do you like to read? it does sound like a funny contest
Yes, I love reading. It’s kind of funny, because architecture, literature, music, painting and sculptures were olympic events from 1912 until 1952. I don’t know why those would be considered sports, but that is quite interesting.
It is interesting, never considered as sports either, do you know who Winston Churchill was?
Yes, he was the British Prime Minister during WWII and in 1953 he won a nobel prize, ironically though, it was in literature and not peace.
I didnt know him as much of a writter but I haver to read some of his novels and works
Yeah, he sounds like an interesting guy. It’s kind of curious though, because it has been said that romantic kissing is a fairly recent development and is rarely mentioned even in ancient greek literature. How can they explain Romeo and Juliet then? That one had a lot of kissing on the lips.
Yeah one that ended with two deaths and poison, hope you have  a nice night. 
Hi there,, do you have a favorite instrument?
Hi there, I do I love the guitar and the piano. How about you?
Yes I love the piano too. Once the BBC played music as they felt they did not have important news
Wow that is impressive. Freddie Mercury and McCarthy also played piano too
Yeah and they played the same piano once, freedie for bohemian rhapsody and mccarthy for hey jude
Nice that is pretty cool. Have you heard of circus galop?
Yeah that is the stress testing song for pianos that humans cannot play
There is a piano that sits on top of the highest mountain in the UK
Oh that must be the one that the climbers found when they were hiking up there
Yes that is the one. Do you ever shop online, like on Amazon?
I do actually. Did you know Jeff built a clock on a mountain?
Yes and it is supposed to run for 10 000 years. AMazon owns IMDB, pretty cool
They are everywhere now. And they have a deal with US Postal Service to deliver on Sundays
That is so convenient. And their workers seem to be really busy all day long 
Yes they can walk anywhere between 7-15 miles, that is a lot of steps
That sure is. Have you ever bought from AmazonBasics?
I have, I know they are supposed to be on the lower end but I find their stuff to be pretty good too
I agree, it is pretty good. The first guy to buy on amazon got a building named after him
Yes and all he had to do was spend less than $30. What a contribution
Yeah pretty awesome for him. Do you like animals?
I do, my favorite are dogs but I also like others like cats, snakes, elephants and such
Hello Friend, do you like baseball?
Yea, I’m a hugh Yankees fan, I never knew a 17 year old female pitcher once struck out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig then got banned, sounds like they signed her
Yes, did you know that baseball managers were uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises?
I didn’t know that was the reason why managers wore uniforms but I’ve heard of mangers playing in the game on rare occasions 
Yes, did you also know that a man found $3 Million worth of 1900’s baseball cards in his grandfather’s attic hidden there since the 1940s?
No that’s crazy, I wonder if they had cards of players on the 1908 World Series winning Cubs
That could be.  Did you also know that kickball is also called soccer-baseball in Canada?
No, that’s an odd name. Did you know in baseball if a player catches a ball in their hat  the opposing team gets three bases instead of being out?
That’s cool. Did you know that after the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series, over 5 million people celebrated in the streets, making it one of the largest gatherings in human history?
No but I’m not surprised, it had been 108 years since the Cubs last won a world series
Yes, and the Chicago Cubs were the first baseball team to win back-to-back world series, and didn’t win again until 2016.
I never knew the Cubs used to be named the Orphans, I wonder why they were called that
Not sure but I know that the Chicago Cubs and the Atlanta Braves are the two oldest teams in the major league baseball, both having been founded the same year as the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
Interesting, I never knew the Cubs had pitchers with 4 and 6 fingers on their pitching hand, I wonder if those features gave them an advantage
I’m not sure but in 1945, the Chicago Cubs baseball team was "cursed" when the stadium security wouldn’t let a man named Billy Sianis stay in a World Series stadium with his smelly pet goat.  The cubs did not play in a World Series again until 2016.
Lol, spooky. Did you know that the Dodgers lost the most world series than any other team?
Yes, did you know that as of 2018 the World Series has been contested 114 times?
Yes and the AL has the edge with 66 victories compared to the NL’s 48
Fascinating.  Did you know that in the 1992 World Series that the US Marine Corps color guard carried the Canada flag into the stadium upside down?
Lol no, maybe the US marines were trying to get into the Toronto Blue Jays head
That could be. Nice chatting and have a good night.
Hi, do you like baseball/
Hai. How are you?
Did you know why baseball managers do wear their uniforms during a game?
Yes... same dress code to baseball managers
Yeah, if there is a need they will have to play, I  have never seen that happen!
oh...why are you saw that happen
I did play kickball when i was a child did you play as well?
oh really nice.. I am play football...
Intersting. In canada kickball is called, soccer baseball, I think it makes sense!
yes.. I think sports are giving knowledge.
Did you know baseball is really popular in japan?
yes.. I know.. But i don’t know about baseball. Are you explain about baseball.
Well, baseball is a really fun sport between two teams, the offensive , who are the batters and the defensive who are in the field.
oh...very nice explanation. 
Then the batter team, once they get to hit the ball, they run the bases and If they complete the bases, they score a run
wow...very interesting game. I will try to play baseball.
Yes, i agree is a lot of fun to play baseball and also to watch the world series!
ok... That game was really fun... I am also watch the baseball world series.
it is exciting because it consists of a seven game playoff, so it is not just one night, you get to extend the enjoyment many nights
oh... I definitely play and watch the baseball game. It’s really very interesting... 
Well you are right. I hope you have a nice day!
Have you heard of Doug Harey?
Wasn’t he an umpire for the MLB?
Yes he just died at 87 years of age.
I guess he was a big deal, and he lived quite a while. He’ll be missed though
He must’ve been an interesting character to earn the nick name ’God’.
He was one of those umpires that knew what he was doing
Yup, he earned his spot in the hall of fame after calling 4,673 games.
And five World Series, which is a big leagues in the MLB. He wasn’t intimidated by anyone, it seems
He was around to see some of the first world series that first started in 1903.
That’s incredible! Do you pay attention to baseball much?
No I did when I was younger but lost interest. How bout you?
Every once in a while. It’s one of those sports I would rather play than watch. The Japanese are such big fans of baseball that they would probably take the name "national pastime" from the Americans if they could
Yea they are usually surprised to find so many americans like it too.
Enough that people used to collect baseball cards. One man found a collection in his grandfather’s attic that was worth three million dollars
thats a lot of money. are any managers cards worth anything? they do wear the uniform after all.
Probably only if they step in and play the game. I’ve never seen any of them do it, but that would be an interesting thing to see
I think that would be fun to see, like the cubs winning the championship after 108 years.
It would be fun to see them all play kickball sometime. In Canada, they call the game soccer-baseball
I dont think a couple would schedule all 2430 games throughout 24 years for soccer baseball. like one couple did for baseball.
They might if the game got enough sponsors. They could even play it in extreme conditions like in the snow or on ice. Wearing hockey skates
People would watch it just for the sake of getting together.
Hey how are you doing, ever have problem with the dust fallout while having your wood floors finished?
Never, lol. have you?
I haven’t but if you were wondering, it’s best to clean everything before you do so there is no dust to begin with.
That is a good point, start off on the right foot. I wonder if you can buy products on amazon
I’m sure you can, might be more than $27.95, that was the amount spent by the first customer on Amazon.
I heard that person got a building named after them, that would be awesome, and definitely worth the 28 dollars. I can’t believe Amazon started in 1994
For sure, started as a book store. The USPS has a contract to deliver Amazon packages on Sunday. You think Amazon is getting too big?
I think Amazon has gotten so big, but I think in a good way. I just hope they turn into a monopoly.
For sure, they kind of already are. Or at least selling all that cheap stuff kind of hurts the market overall. The warehouse workers work a ton, between 7 and 15 miles a day they walk.
I couldn’t imagine walking that much per day. I would be in the best shape of my life. Did you know that amazon has another site that sells their returned goods at a discount
I was not aware of that, what it is called? Amazon owns IMDB too, that’s surprising.
I don’t know what it is called, I want to check it out lol. I don’t mind getting an even bigger discount on amazon goods. I wonder why the own imdb
Yah, it’s just out of box stuff usually. Did you know there are no snakes in New Zealand?
New Zealand sounds like the place to be, snakes scare me lol. I don’t get why some snakes give birth and some lay eggs
Yah, they’re pretty messed up, it is interesting to know that the fear of snakes is engrained in our brains.
snakes are crazy lol
Truly, very crazy. I’m surprised Crocodiles are more closely related to bird than snakes and lizards.
I would never have guessed that. I wonder what the relationship is
Not really sure, maybe closer to dinosaurs?
Yea I think that is it, they say dinosaurs had feathers like birds lol, that would be interesting to see for sure!
For sure, it was great chatting with you. I hope you have a good rest of the night, take care!
Are you a fan of baseball?
I am, I love the game! What about you?
I don’t mind it. Do you know why managers wear uniforms?
Yep, because they are technically able to play for their team if the need arises. I don’t recall ever seeing one play though.
That’s correct. I’ve never seen it happen either. 
I’ve heard that up from 1981 until 2005 a married couple actually scheduled all 2,430 major league games played each year.
Wow! That’s some serious devotion to the game. 
Yeah it is. I find it fascinating that baseball is so popular in Japan. I remember watching games when I was stationed there and the crowds were amazing, even for small local games.
I had heard that it was so huge over there that they are surprised that it is our past time. 
Did you ever collect baseball cards?
I did not. How about you?
I collected them with my dad when I was a kid. I wish I could have found a collection like this one man did. He found three million dollars worth of 1900s baseball cards in his grandfather’s attic. They had been hidden since the 1940s.
Wow! That’s amazing. I wish I came across something like that myself. 
Do you know that kickball is called soccer-baseball in Canada? 
I did not. That seems like an overly complicated name. 
Poor Canada though, in the 1992 World Series, Marine Corps color guard carried the Canadian Flag into the stadium upside down.
Oh no! That was a major error. Did you know that until their recent win the last time the Cubs won the world series the Ottoman Empire still existed?
Yep that was such a huge win for them. I heard over 5 million people celebrated in the streets!
I can see why. They were also the first team to win back-to-back world series but then didn’t win again until the recent one which was a huge gap in between wins. 
The team was supposedly cursed in 1945 when stadium security wouldn’t let a man named Billy Sianis bring his goat into the stadium.
That is a very strange superstition for them to have. It was nice chatting with you. Have a lovely night. 
How’s it going, do you follow baseball? The Nationals recently traded Daniel Murphy and Matt Adams to the Cubs
I don’t follow baseball much, but I do think I heard something recently in the news about how the Cubs won over the Phillies? It’s so confusing when they trade players for me to follow!
Yea, I guess the manager Martinez isn’t doing too good in Washington and traded them away
I think the Cubs have been having a lot of trouble with their player’s health. I hope they can turn it around and have a good season!
Maybe, but the Cubs haven’t been too lucky since they started in 1903
I think I’ve heard about that...are they the team that one back to back and then haven’t won another World Series since then?
The Cubs didn’t win until 2016, they beat the Royals I believe 
Oops meant won not one. I remember a long time ago they lost in a famous World Series game to the White Sox. I’m glad they won recently, as it’s been a long time!
Yea, When the Cubs won 5 million people celebrated in the street, they have been waiting a long time
I bet that was one of the best baseball celebrations ever! I heard that Ronald Regan was a broadcaster for the Cubs in the thirties. He had a very interesting life!
Yea, wonder if he called the infamous Billy Goat game
How do you play that? I heard that when the Cubs first started playing baseball they were the Chicago Orphans. I wonder what the story behind that is, though?
I don’t know, the Cubs were founded the same year as the Battle of Little Bighorn so maybe it has something to do with the times
That’s a fun fact! I also hear they’re called the North Siders because of where Wrigley Field is and The White Sox has their field on the South Side of Chicago. Have you ever been there?
No but I’d love to visit Wrigley field, it is one of the most historic baseball parks
I hear that it’s a really nice place and the culture is cool there too. In example, when the visitors hit a homer into the bleachers the cubs fans throw it back into the field! lol I’d like to see that.
THat’s pretty crazy. I heard Japan has a crazy baseball culture too and are shocked to find out baseball is America’s pasttime
I’ve heard of that and wonder what the food is like at a Japanese baseball game. Do you think they’d serve both sushi and hot dogs?
Probably, I wonder if Japan has baseball cards like in the US, a guy once found 3 million dollars worth in his grandfathers attic
That sounds like a really cool find, especially if you know the right baseball card collectors. I think I’m gonna go collect some dinner. TTYL!
Have a good one
Hi there! How’s it going? Are you a baseball fan?
Hi. I’m doing very well thanks. I’m do watch baseball on occasion and I’m a casual fan.
Do you root for a specific team? Long-time Yankee fan over here.
You probably won’t like this but I’m Red Sox fan. I heard that Eric Hosmer signed with the San Diego Padres  for $144 million in an eight year contract.
Haha you’re right I don’t like the Red Sox. Yes I believe the Hosmer contract was last year. I think that’s going to end up being a bad contract.
Me too. I think its too much money for a player that has proven himself. He is a 28 years old and he plays in the first base position and he did very well as a Royal.
By the end of that deal he will be in his mid to late 30’s and nowhere ear as good. Definitely an overpay. Not as crazy as those Machado and Harper deals for over 300 million though.
No nothing like that. He has won 4 Gold Gloves in his career and I will like to see him in a Red Sox uniform.
That’s true the Red Sox only weakness now is 1st base. Who’s their starting, Mitch Moreland?
You are correct. I also heard that Hosmer will be making $20 million over each of the first 5 seasons with the Padres.
That’s smart to front load it. It’s crazy how much these guys get to play baseball. It’s not even as physically demanding as football, basketball or hockey.
I agree with you completely. Those sports are way more physical than baseball. Did you know that the Dodgers have lost more world series championships than any other baseball team?
They’ve been around so long, it makes sense. I think they lost a lot of them to the Yankees. It’s funny prior to the cubs just winning recently the last time they won before that the Ottoman Empire still existed.
Ha Ha!! The Dodgers are bad. They were crushed by the Red Sox
I hate how good Mookie Betts is. I think the Yankee’s will give the Red Sox a run for their money this year though.
I believe that to be the case. The Yankees are very talented club and always gave a hard time to the Red Sox whether we played them here or at Yankees.
Have you been to Fenway Park? I actually saw a game there on a trip to Boston. It’s a really cool stadium.
I have been to Fenway Park a few times and its really nice and especially when we play against the Yankees. I think the Padres will be fine because their ownership is investing .
Well I don’t know if you heard, but the Padres did just sign Manny Machado this year. I think his contract was like 300 million for 10 years.
You’re correct. They are building the team and I think they will do well in the long term but as far as them making it to the World Series, I’m not too sure about that.
I don’t think they have the pitching yet. That’s so important for winning the World Series. Anyway it was nice chatting with you, enjoy the rest of your day!
You’re correct. It all comes down to exceptional pitching to make it to the World Series. I was very nice chatting with you today as well. Have a nice day!!!
Take care.
hello, do you watch baseball?
I do, it is my favorite sport. Do you watch? 
I watch it from time to time. Do you know why the managers wear uniforms?
I think they are technically allowed to play. 
Yeah, good for them, do you know what kickball is called in Canada?
No, do you play kickball? I did for fun a few years ago. 
I do not play it but apparently in Canada it is called soccer-baseball
Awesome, I’ve only been to Canada once. Have you been? 
Yes, I have friend there so I go all the time. Nice country and nice people
Awesome. Did you know Baseball is super popular in Japan? 
Yeah and they cannot believe that in the US is just a pastime?
yeah, that’s awesome. The Cubs were the first team to win back to back world series. 
Nice, good for them. Do you know who used to do the schedule for major baseball laegue
No, do you? Apparently the Ottoman Empire was still in existence when the Cubs won the world series. 
Oh wow that means it goes way back then. Yeah it was a couple who did it for 24 years
Yeah, that is crazy. Apparently the cubs had a player with 6 fingers, doesn’t seem possible. 
Wow, that is so interesting indeed. Did you know the women’s cup had higher ratings than the world series?
I can believe it. Some of the games can be boring if you aren’t a fan. 
That is very true. When the CUbs won in 2016, 5 million people celebrated i the streets
Wow, that must have made a huge mess. They were the first team to win it back to back, but then didn’t win again until 2016. 
And the largest in history. Nice chatting with you.
Hi.  Can you play the piano?
I can play some, I have an electric piano that I keep plugged in in my room.
Thats really cool, I can play a bit, but spend more time with other instruments.  Did you know Freddie Mercury used the same piano for Bohemian Rhapsody that McCartney used for Hey Jude in the recording studio?
That’s really cool. I wish the news would play piano instead of news these days like they did back in 1930.
I know. It would be far better than the slanted views they all put out today.  Id actually enjoy that.
Do you like Amazon? I have Amazon prime video and it with Netflix is all I really use for tv these days.
I love amazon!  Love how quickly they can get things out, even on sundays
Maybe I should get a job in one of the Amazon warehouses, sounds like a good idea to lose some extra weight since they walk 7 to 15 miles per day!
That might be a good gig for me too, trying to up my step game.  
I would love to visit the clock in the mountain that Jeff Bezos had built.
That would be cool.  It is going to run for 10,000 years so youve got time.
So how do you feel about snakes? I have a pet king snake myself, and I love them.
